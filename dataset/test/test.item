Great movies classics Excellent double feature. Nice value pack! This was a gift for someone. They liked it a lot.. Good price for both movies. this is an outstanding pair of terrific movies Great ! Casino by itself is an all-time classic. Alone I would give it 5 stars. Carlito's way is only 3 stars. The movie doesn't provide enough information about his past. They make references to it, but you're left out in the cold wishing you could have at least a glimpse of it. It's quite stereotypical, quite similar to many other movies, and the ending is quite predicatble. Casino one of the best mob movies all time Carlitos way a classic as well Very enjoyable movies! Action packed! Completely Satisfied, 5-Star Seller. Good actor. Bad language I am specifically focusing on """"Carlito's Way, """"although I bought this double feature disc. This has to be one of the best gangster films ever made. It is as a work of cinemagraphic art: very beautiful and elegant. The music, the colors, the sets, the cinematography, the action are elevated way above the realm of brutality and destruction. And the main character, Carlito, and his story run against gangster flick tradition. Carlito is a good guy. He grew up in an Italian/Puerto Rican/African American ghetto on the upper east side of Manhattan where he learned to be a gangster and deal drugs. When the movie starts he is released from prison on early parole and we soon learn that Carlito has the heart not of a criminal, but of a lion. He is a tough, strong guy who wants to go straight and lead a decent life. Al Pacino enfolds courage, honor, loyalty, decency, warmth, tenderness, kindness, mercy, and love into this beautifully nuanced exposition. In my opinion, it is one of the best performances of his career. """"Carlito's Way"""" is a film whose dramatic dimensions are Shakespearean. I loved the central character whose story arc has been sealed by Fate, and I cared about and believed in all the other characters. And don't let me forget that DePalma includes scenes of beautifully choreographed suspense that can compete with suspense masters. This is a beautifully wrought work of art. Do yourself a favor and see it. Good movie Excellent Job!!!!!!!! Great movies Love ALL Pacino & DeNiro movies!!! loved both of these movies. Have watched them both several times. Glad to have this dvd i love it and it played well in my cd player This was a gift for someone. They liked it a lot.. Good price for both movies. Casino one of the best mob movies all time Carlitos way a classic as well two classics. Must have in any collection This is an awesome double feature in the gangster genre. The movies comes on separate discs which I like much better than having to turn on over to watch the movies. So easy to scratch one side or the other. Casino is a Scorcese mob film in which Deniro and Pesci are eastern gangsters who travel west to Las Vegas to ply their trade at the casino business. Filled with tough scrapes, shady deals, a rise to power and of course, the inevitable fall, Casino fires hot and heavy. Carlito's Way is a bit more romanticized since there is a love interest for the title character who is not a pill popping, alcoholic gold digger. The film tells the opposite story where a veteran gangster promises to go straight...and actually means it. Definitely one of Pacino's best performances, former drug dealer Carlito has just been released from prison thanks to his crafty lawyer and seeks a new life and a better one. A very good gangster film about flawed people. Casino. great movie nice! great Great double feature. Nice value pack! Very happy with item and service! Casino is one of my favorite movies.

6055	"When Mr. Dashwood dies  he must leave the bulk of his estate to the son by his first marriage  which leaves his second wife and their three daughters (Elinor  Marianne  and Margaret) in straitened circumstances. They are taken in by a kindly cousin  but their lack of fortune affects the marriageability of both practical Elinor and romantic Marianne. When Elinor forms an attachment for the wealthy Edward Ferrars  his family disapproves and separates them. And though Mrs. Jennings tries to match the worthy (and rich) Colonel Brandon to her  Marianne finds the dashing and fiery John Willoughby more to her taste. Both relationships are sorely tried.Drama Romance , 18th-century 19th-century adaptation adapted-from:book affectionate based-on-a-book based-on-book beautiful-scenery beautifully-filmed british chick-flick classic costume-drama england excellent heartwarming jane-austen literature london oscar-(best-actress) passionate period-piece romance romantic sisters ,""I loved this movie as a child and was eager to jump and buy it online. I would suggest it to anyone looking for a good """"Chick Flick"""". Great! Great Movie Quite simply one of the most perfect films ever made. Director Ang Lee has a deft touch with this, Jane Austen's more contemplative (and possibly superior) counterpart to Pride and Prejudice. Full of tenderness and dry wit, with an ensemble cast of seasoned British actors. THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE VERSION OF SENSE AND SENSIBILITY! This is definitely a girls movie Scenery was great, costumes were well donel, screenplay was wonderful, actors were engaging, The entire family enjoyed this film. I can feel a new Vitality through out my whole body!!! Just perfect! Everything and more then I expected!! Thanks for you great service and fast shipping!!! Loved the movie This is a great version of the book. Marianne's lover seems a bit too old for her, though I know in the book he was...still, for a movie, it's nice to get a younger looking man :) My favorite movie of all! I can see why Emma Thompson won the Academy Award for best adaptation. It was amazing. It is painful to recall that the glorious baritone of Alan Rickman is now no longer with us -- but we do have his presence captured in this endearing interpretation of Jane Austen's """"Sense and Sensibility."""" Emma Thompson *carefully* adapted her witty screenplay from Miss Austen's classic, and an ardent reader will be satisfied by abundant quotations taken directly from the text. Thompson's additions do not detract from the beauty of this film, where everything from the wardrobe, settings and *Etiquette* of the Regency period is accurately depicted. (E.g.: look at the comportment of the ladies when they receive visitors to their cottage. Even the posing of the hands in their laps reflects authentic 18th century etiquette.) All of these tiny details produce a film which is a joy to watch. So please buy this film if you love top-notch acting, accurate costumes, settings, etiquette -- and if you believe, as I do, that Mr. Rickman's Colonel Brandon was one for the ages. Holds up well 20 years later - Alan Rickman, sigh. It has just the right blend of comedy and seriousness and does full justice to Austen's characters, plot and themes. A few characters are eliminated, (and of course the lovely and brilliant Emma Thompson was nowhere near 19 when she played Elinor) but overall it does a remarkable job at being faithful to the novel while still being a living, breathing alive movie. Wonderful version of a classic novel! One of my all-time favorite love stories!! Beautiful to look at. Good Jane Austin movie. Well acted & directed, except for Hugh Grant who acted like a stick of wood. Excellent...! It's an okay adaptation. A little bit too formulaic. The characters never quite step out of the Jane Austen novel, dutiful British daughters. I wish they had been characters in their own right in the script. Of course they are all very good actors so its worthwhile. Emma Thompson did a masterful job with this wonderful Jane Austen story. It is by far my favorite version. Watch this movie all the time, like background music. The most beautiful filming in some of the scenes. And I will eventually """"lose"""" it to one of my daughters!.... Best movie ever!!! Oh, Colonel Brandon. Watched this again since Rickman's passing hit me hard. Not sure how many times I have watched this but I lost count. Wonderful movie! Great movie! Love Jane Austen's writings and Emma Thompson wrote a wonderful screen play! Soft -beautiful - elegant! A Favorite! I love this movie!! One of my favorite Austin books, all the actors were well chosen. I'm happy I got a copy of this dvd GREAT MOVIE Loved this also. Also have viewed this several times. Sense and Sense Ability (1995) is easily the very best adaption of Jane Austen's much-loved book thus far. From the outstanding cast to the lovely scenery, this film will draw you in within moments and hold your attention to the very end. I put this movie amount my """"top ten."""" It's one that I can watch time and time agaon. This is the only version I'll ever want to watch. Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, all of them are perfectly cast. Everything, including the music, is fitting and so beautiful. I can watch it over and over! One of the best book to screen adaptations I've watched. Great movie, very enjoyable, and truer to the actual plot than most Bought this for my mother as a birthday gift. She loves it and so do I! It pulls at your heart and makes you love the characters and story. Totally worth the buy! If you love the movies of the past and of love and romance, this is a great one. Love can hurt, especially when you love someone you can't have or shouldn't have. But true love always wins! This is one of my favorite versions of 'Sense & Sensibility'. It is humorous, lovely, and directed very well. I highly recommend it. I just love Jane Austen! I enjoy the values and the sentiments. Such an enjoyable way to relax and unwind. I hadn't watched the movie in a while and decided I might as well purchase it. It was every bit as good as I remembered. We have loved this movie ever since we first saw it. Getting it on Blu-ray was a real treat. Good buy! There was way to much sensibility and not near enough sense in this movie for me. My wife however says that is was the best """"short"""" version of this classic Jane Austin tale to date. """"Sense and Sensibility"""" is good adaptation of one of Jane Austen's most beloved novels. Jane Austen always found a way to create the most impossible situations imaginable to push her characters to the limit. This is the story of Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Elinor (Emma Thompson) and their unlucky situation in life. Due to their father dying they are virtually left homeless except for a small amount of money to live on each year. The story begins with a dramatic deathbed wish and you just know things are not going to work out for the best immediately. What surprised me was how funny this movie is when at times it is a near tragedy. Also the English countryside is so beautiful and there are a couple scenes in the amazing family library. Throughout this movie you will be on the edge of your seat wondering what could go wrong next. There are so many twists and turns in the story that it makes the movie absolutely fascinating. The men in this movie are also very interesting. They range from flaky to extremely chivalrous. Some of them also seem more swayed by money than love. Marianne and Elinor also must endure extreme emotional distress before they get what they want. But in the end you could not wish for a better conclusion. ~The Rebecca Review If you enjoy Jane Austen, this is a classic production of her novel SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. It is full of engaging actors who brighten the screen like Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman and others. It caught the humor and depth of Austen's novel. The scenery is scrumptious - especially love the cottage home the sisters move into. I can watch this film over and over again. It should charm you. The Blu-ray edition really brings out the colors and beauty of the English countryside, estates, and mansions. The ballroom scene in particular is fantastic. Worth adding to your collection, I think. However, main drawback is that is does not have the commentary track by Emma Thompson, so don't get rid of your dvd version. Looking for a quick review of Austin's novel, I was charmed by this fabulous cast! Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant...It just doesn't get any better than this! I bought this movie from England because it had not been released in the US yet. Region B will not play an a regular Blu-ray player, so a while back, I purchased an all region Blu-ray player beaches there were several movies I wanted that were region B produced. This is a well written story. Beautifully produced and directed. As a lover of Pride and Prejudice, I have to say that this is a good movie as well. At first i didn't think I was going to like it, but I'm glad I stuck it out. It's one of those that I'll probably watch over and over. Kate Winslett does not disappoint! My wife loves this, as do I. I watched this film 4 times already and I still find it very agreeable. It's really funny and very well done. First time i watched it, for some reason Emma thompson and Kate winslet looked the same to me and I didn't know who was Elinor or Marianne either. Clearly I must have drank to much beer at the time. If you are a Jane Austen fan, then by all means pick this film up. The book was very good as well though long and confusing in the beginning at least. I dare say though that just like Pride and Prejudice, you should see the film first before reading the book. It will make the reading so much easier for you in the end. The story is simple enough. It's about two sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Marianne is basically open to everyone about everything and Elinore keeps her emotions and feeling in deep check. I am somewhat like Marianne and i've had the most unfortunate experience with an """"Elinor"""" of my own who was an absolute complete waste of my time, but i digress. They both meet guys and go through trivial experiences and balance each other out along the way. All the other characters were also very well like and fun to watch. While Pride and Prejudice,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Pride-And-Prejudice/dp/1453693319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Pride And Prejudice</a>, is my favorite Austin novel, Sense and Sensibility,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Sense-and-Sensibility-Barnes-Noble-Classics-Series-B-N-Classics/dp/1593080492/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Sense and Sensibility (Barnes & Noble Classics Series) (B&N Classics)</a>, comes in a close second, and this film version is my favorite. How could one complain with such a stellar cast? Nearly every character is played by a seasoned veteran of British television, theater and cinema. Hugh Grant plays a very convincing and understated Mr. Edward Ferrars. His pregnant pauses and stuttered responses suggest a man so overwhelmed by society that he is afraid to utter anything at all. Emma Thompson's Miss Elinor Dashwood, the tower of strength her family depends upon to keep the family circumstances afloat, is a total triumph. The finale, where she finally comes unglued, is so in keeping with the tension with which the character has been dealing throughout the story. Kate Winslet, while generally not my favorite actress, does a fantastic portrayal of Maryann Dshwood, the headstrong and emotional sister who plunges headlong into a romance and almost comes to disaster when her hero proves to be made of clay. Even the youngest sister Margaret whose perky personality is put across despite her infrequent appearance on the screen, leaves one wondering what became of her and what she thought about these events later in life. Someone should write her story. Alan Rickman, at last in a romantic rather than a sinister role, is a wonderfully restrained suitor of Maryann. He is a man of strong emotions kept bearly under control. Harriet Walter, the heroine of the Lord Peter Whimsey mystery series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Lord-Peter-Wimsey-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B00009WNVN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Lord Peter Wimsey - The Complete Collection</a>, is here a wonderfully nasty sister-in-law of the Dashwood girls, and her response to the secret engagement of her older brother to her young protege, Lucy Steel, is a comedic masterpiece. Mrs. Jennings the inquisitive inlaw of Mrs. Dashwood's cousin Sir John Middleton, is played by Elizabeth Spriggs,"""	Sense and Sensibility

Don't bother, unless you like to watch girls portrayed as having no brains. I love a good teen-age movie, but this one ain't it. Poor script and obvious performances make this one fall right off the charts. Alicia Silverstone can be appealing, but she can't overcome this clunker... Such a clever twist on the classic tale of """"Emma"""", but parents may want to watch first before showing to tweens. There is a lot of drinking and some marijuana use at a party. Also some other language and innuendos that may not be age appropriate. For everyone else, it is cleverly done. Really enjoy this movie every time I see it. I received all around great service from start to finish. It was a gift and he was very happy with it. One of those enduring classics that never loses its ability to strike a nostalgic and comedic note, Clueless is just hilarious from start to finish. Its a shame that Alicia Silverstone, who is remarkable in this film, didn't make good on the potential she showed with his hilarious performance. But even with her follies as an actress, shell always have Clueless, and so will we. This loose adaptation of Jane Austens Emma puts us in the 90s High School system with Cher, a spoiled rich 15 yearold who wants to find love amidst a sea of losers and the occasional Baldwin. Shes young, nave and about to leave some life lessons. Before there was Juno, there was Clueless. Don't expect any deep comment on the human condition, this is just a fun and mindless romp. Guys should watch this with wives /girlfriends and a bowl of popcorn. Lighthearted, but intelligent. The characters are seemingly shallow and self-centered, but watching them live their lives shows their humanity and depth. Not a life-changing movie, but definitely fun and memorable. This is such a fun movie to watch. I miss Brittany Murphy everytime I see it. She was great along side Alicia. This is one of my favorite movies ever! I loved it when it first came to theaters and I love it still. This movie has stood the test of time and popularity! Clueless has changed the way American people speak today as well as poking fun at the rich! Clueless is a must-see either when you're alone and don't have anything to do or hanging with your girlfriends on a Friday night. They certainly don't make good movies like this before! This is one of favorites. In the words of Cher, """"Loves It!"""" This is the first time I saws this movie and it is an excellent modern interpretation of Jane Austen's Emma. It is cute and funny and well acted. This is another great teen comedy. A very well written film with a great cast! The best of it's kind. The DVD has a great transfer and some cool extras. This is one of those movies that """"Everyone"""" has seen. It's a modern adaptation of Emma and is so modernly well done down to the dialogue, slang, clothing, and teen issues. It transformed very well into a modern story and is a must-see chick flick. Humerous and surprisingly smart. Alicia Silverstone pulls off Emma's character wonderfully! Clueless takes you back to the 1990's and you remember your days back then. It's a not-so-typical chick flick and the movie itself is great. It has attitude and sass. This DVD not only includes the movie, but it includes SO MANY special features. The special features include clips of the cast returning to the set to talk about certain areas of the movie. Also, the special features are more in quantity than what DVDs usually have. Here is a list of the special features that you will be receiving if you purchase this product: 1) The Class of '95 - A look at the cast then and now 2) Creative Writing - Writer/Director Amy Heckerling talks about creating the world of """"Clueless"""" 3) Fashion 101 - How the filmmakers invented the trendsetting fashions that defined the movie 4) Language Arts - Director and cast give the 411 on the groundbreaking slang and vocabulary used in the movie 5) """"Suck 'N Blow"""" - A Tutorial 6) Driver's Ed 7) We're History - Stories of the cast and crew on the making of """"Clueless"""" 8) 2 Theatrical Trailers 9) Widescreen Version Enhanced for 16:9 TVs 10) Dolby Digital 11) English Subtitles 12) Spanish Subtitles I hope this review helps. For my money, Amy Heckerling's updated version of Jane Austen's great novel, for all its changes, does more justice to the work than any of the seemingly """"traditional"""" film and TV adaptations of recent years. It's true, of course, that the drug and sex elements would have no place in Austen's world, but the essential cluelessness of the initially snobbish, smarty-pants heroine has been retained, which clarifies why Austen thought the Emma character overall a heroine nobody except the author herself """"would much like."""" Retained, too, is the heroine's essential innocence, which turns out to be her saving grace. What Heckerling also refuses to derail - and this is most important - is the persistent ironic wit which distinguishes the novel. Other versions of recent years fall victim to beautiful period costumes and become just relatively humorless, prettily photographed, largely empty Regency romances. """"Clueless"""" retains the satiric bite which led one critic to call Austen's style not genial but distinguished instead by a """"regulated hatred"""" directed against deficiencies in sense or generous feeling. At first glance, it may look like the typical pointless high school comedy. However, it caught me by surprise. Its utterly original (though technically based off of Emma) and endearing, totally funny and deliciously sweet. Before there was Mean Girls, there was Clueless, the best comedic High School film. It's not crass in any way or obnoxious or cliche. It actually has a heart and a good message. And its a perfect age for anyone really. Just purchaseing on DVD, I had on VHS but been phasing all those out obviously. Those are like so 1995....lol When I first saw this movie, I was 12. Of course, at the time I loved the movie. I thought that Alicia Silverstone was such an interesting actress and I liked how the movie included """"real life"""" from a kid's perspective. Keep in mind, at the age of 12 my brain was not fully developed. I do not know how any adult can sit still long enough to watch the opening credits of this movie. It is absolutely nauseating and ridiculous from beginning to end. Frankly, I am also very offended by the scenes of the kids using and abusing recreational drugs at that party. I don't care if it's just a movie and I don't care if you think I am a prude, drugs are disgusting and should never be glamorized to children. I'm sorry that's just the way I feel. The only person I enjoyed in this movie was Julie Brown as the gym teacher, Ms. Stoeger. She was a hard pill to swallow but also a very clever supporting character, who I barely recognized. What this movie does not tell the viewer is that money and status and clothing and material possessions do not make you a better person. As a kid watching this I never knew that and I thought that Cher was such a lucky child to have everything that she did. As an adult, I see how sad and tragic and out-of-control her life really was. If you want to see a realistic presentation of teen life as it was and is and should be then I recommend getting any of the first 4 seasons of 90210. BTW, the actress who played Dionne, Stacey Dash is in her 40's! I'm not very surprised because she looked like she was pushing 28 or 29. Talk about being miscast. Can someone please tell Bravo to stop showing this smack every few days? Is their programming dept. really that un-creative and lazy? Thank goodness for on-demand otherwise I'd never find anything on TV except for this shameless example of degradation. I really disliked teen movies. Didn't like the 1980s Brat Pack movies (including Molly Ringwald's), didn't like the 1990s movies (e.g., """"Never Been Kissed"""", """"She's All That"""", """"10 Things""""). Sitting through them was torture, so I never bothered with """"Clueless"""" at the time it came out, thinking it was of the same ilk. It so isn't. """"Clueless"""" is two steps above the other teen movies. It doesn't make the mistake of taking high school too seriously as the others do; it pokes endless fun at the genre and teens in general. At the same time, however, it has an element of affection which the funny parodies of teen films don't have. It's a perfect combination; Amy Heckerling deserved that WGA nomination. Alicia Silverstone is hilarious as the well-meaning but clueless Cher, and Heckerling channels the funniest aspects of Austen's Emma to make Cher. Her well-meaning generosity is coupled with just a little shallowness. Heckerling also does a fantastic job of making Cher at once countercultural but even cooler because of it. Her rant about boys who wear pants eighty sizes too big is great, and she manages to deliver an anti-drug message without being preachy. Unlike recent movies like """"Knocked Up"""" and """"Juno"""", Heckerling, with earnest humor, has Cher make virginity cool - """"You see how picky I am about my shoes and they only go on my feet."""" I don't know how Heckerling pulled it off, but she does. Paul Rudd is adorable as the George Knightley (Josh) falling for Cher, and Brittany Snow and Breckin Meyer make the dopey Tai and skater Travis a fantastic pair. Elisa Donovan's catty Amber, who manages to land Elton, is fantastic. My favorites after Silverstone are Stacey Dash and Donald Faison as Dionne and Murray and Dan Hedaya as Cher's father. Dash and Faison are so hilarious on screen together; Murray's head shaving and their exchange about """"woman"""" and """"Miz Dionne"""" are laugh-out-loud good. Dan Hedaya delivers on Hecklering's script; his comment to Christian (""""I've got a .45 and a shovel. I doubt anyone would miss you"""") is delivered with all the grumpiness of Austen's Mr. Woodhouse. Again, though, the genius of this movie lies in Heckerling's script. She makes a surprisingly close rendition of """"Emma"""", despite the radically different setting, and manages to infuse it with both some of Austen's amusing look at the characters as well as modern humor. (Dionne's hats are a riot.) Very fun. Cher Horowitz(Alicia Silverstone) is your typical average 15 year old girl. Only of course her father is a rich lawyer, she's gorgeous, spoiled rotten and lives in a Beverly Hills mansion. Now with that said, this modern day take on Jane Austen's masterpiece Emma obviously falls short of the original and well, our heroine is a bit of an airhead. BUT although slightly vapid we begin to actually care for these characters and especially Cher, with her attempts at self improvement and love for her family and friends. (She may not be as self-centered as we imagined?) It's a film you can watch over and over again, and it had yet to become dated! Paul Rudd also adds a lot to the film as Josh, Cher's adorable ex-stepbrother. Is it a classic, perhaps not, but it does everything it sets out to and is still tons of fun! And who doesn't love walking around spouting 'As If!' Cluless is a story about Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and her friends who together live a fairly empty and meaningless highschool life. The journey takes a turn when Cher's college age former step-brother comes to stay with Cher and her father and gets Cher to start thinking about more than just herself. A very humorous coming-of-age comedy where"""	Clueless

It's a classic of the mid-1970s and defined (and capped off) the era of the independent spirit of Hollywood (captured in Peter Biskind's book, EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS. Scorsese, Coppola, Bogdanovich, Spielberg, Lukas, Rafaelson, Hal Ashby, Warren Beatty, and even Jack Nicholson brought a European sensibility to Hollywood during the late 60s and early 70s. In some ways, TAXI DRIVER (1976) represented the end of that era, even as JAWS (released the year before) signaled the new direction Hollywood would go in -- and still goes in -- to the great detriment of American film. Thank goodness for the Indies! My problem with this disk is that, in order to fit the 4K transfer on it, they had to drop all the extras that appear on the """"standard"""" blu-ray of the film. I don't have a 4K television, and I imagine you would only see the difference on a VERY large television or in a theater auditorium. I'd rather have the extras -- even though I'm a perfectionist when it comes to picture and sound. Get the 4K if you have a 4K television and it really makes a difference to you. The extras are pretty good and I'm glad I returned this disk and got the other one (with an almost identical cover). Great film, of course, if a little dated (gun violence is so prevalent now that the younger generations are virtually inured to it). This film loses one star due only to its presentation on Amazon Prime. It's certainly not in high definition and the colors are even darker than Scorsese could have intended. This is a gritty film about cab drivers in New York city , And Robert De Niro is a young cab driver who goes on a rampage from all his disgust of city life. When Robert De Niro was young he had many of his better films and roles , and Taxi Driver is at the top of the list, The Deer Hunter, Cape Fear and other films . A very young Jodie Foster and De niro are the main characters of the story, and life in the big city. You really get the feel what it is like in New York city with all the crime ,cars and noise and how the people live. Great Classic film . A gritty, dark trip into an alley of alienation and isolation Martin Scorsese's """"Taxi Driver"""" appears on Blu-ray in a restored nice looking edition. Always gritty looking detail has been improved and colors look extremely good here. This is a large improvement over the previous DVD edition of the film. At first the film appears a bit dicey when the Columbia logo rolls up on screen but the film improves markedly by the first couple of minutes. Offered in a hardcover book style with a replica of the original poster artwork as well as photos from the movie. Special features include the 1986 commentary track with Scorsese and Schrader from the Criterion laserdisc, an interactive feature that allows you to compare the script to the movie(the script appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen as you're watching the movie progressing with each new scene). It's interesting to compare the finished movie where the actors and Scorsese alter the dialogue to fit the their interpretation of the characters. We also get new commentary tracks by writer Schrader and Professor Robert Kolker. We also get new featurettes including """"God's Lonely Man"""", """"Producing 'Taxi Driver'"""", """"Travis' New York"""" comparing 1975 to 2006, storyboard to film comparisons with Scorsese's introduction and Scorsese discussing the making of the film. I didn't access the """"Movie I.Q."""" special feature here. Shot on a very low budget (less than $1.5 million)and originally slated for director Brian DePalma (who ended up tackling """"Obsession"""" also from a script by """"Taxi Driver"""" writer Paul Schrader which also featured Bernard Herrmann writing the score), """"Taxi Driver"""" became Scorsese and Schrader's first great film. It's fascinating to watch the script-to-screen comparison which illustrates the artistry of writer, actors and director bring to the project making it quite unique. Albert Brooks who makes his film debut here improvised his dialogue as his character wasn't all that fleshed out in the script. He's also quite amusing in a very dark disturbing film. Scorsese makes his debut here as an actor as well when the actor who was originally cast couldn't do the role due to an injury (he appears twice in the film you can also glimpse him sitting on the curb outside the campagin office in the beginning of the film). It's also pretty interesting watching Bickle's reaction to Scorsese's rant and who he considers to be, well, more disturbed than HIM. Bernard Herrmann's moving, powerful score sounds absolutely lovely here. Scorsese and Scharder's powerful glimpse into the mind of an alienated and disturbed lonely man trying to connect with others and finding the only way to do so is the murderous ramapage to """"wash away the flith"""" continues to resonate today. """"Taxi Driver"""" on Blu-ray is HIGHLY recommended. TAXI DRIVER is an iconic film, considered by many to be a masterpiece and the crowning achievement of both Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro. Whatever your opinion this is a powerful film that starts strong and never lets up that has also stood the test of time. Everything in the movie is done so realistically that the story could still be told today. Robert Deniro plays Travis. We know little about him other than that he is an ex marine and a deep insomniac. He also sees the world as a dirty place that needs to be cleaned up. He becomes a taxi driver in the city of New York which takes on a realistic role of its own here. We see the two sides of everything and the same goes for New York. Nothing is held back on showing the realistic gritty underside of the city. But what of the transfer of this movie classic to blu ray. Seems like all the classics are being brought to blu ray, some more succesfully than others. The questions are always how does it look, is it an improvement over the dvd and does it bring the film to new life. TAXI DRIVER was the first film to receive an enhanced 4k restoration and what it does is perform magic on a decades old film. The video presentation is purely amazing. It is funny for when the film starts the Columbia logo is very fuzzy and then the movie starts. It is clear, crisp with colors strong. The film is very definitive in that scenes are either nighttime or daytime, dark or light. The blacks and dark colors are brilliant and all color ratios amazing. Whites contrast perfectly. No matter what the scene everything pops. The night scenes are very realistic and when colors are introduced they are vibrant and real. Nothing is overenhanced. Instead the film looks the way it must have when released originally in theaters. It is leaps and bounds over any dvd version. The climactic scene at the end is brought to new devastating life with this new restoration. Flesh tones are also perfect. Blu ray is put to amazing use here restoring this classic film to all its glory. The graininess here is meant to be here. It represents New York City in full detail. And the audio is just as perfect. The DTS 5.1 audio allows the amazing soundtrack to fully blossom and soar over the entire film. The score here tells the story as much as any character or visual. And dialogue is strong and present. Nothing is wrong here. The film itself is told in a way that it is open to many different interpretations but the blu ray itself needs no debate. It is spectacular. I will reiterate again. The film looks as pure and original as when in the theaters restored to its true glory. Do not hesitate to double dip if you own the dvd. This blu ray shows the movie as a whole new experience. I give this blu ray my highest recommendations.

Scorcese - Storyboard/Film comparison - Galleries - Lobby cards ASIN: B004IFYMYI Studio: Sony Taxi Driver is not an easy film to watch, it's both gritty and confronting at times, and the depiction of New York as an """"open sewer"""" is pretty depressing. That said it is an important film in the history of cinema, not the least because it serves as an interesting glimpse of society in the time in which in was made. De Niro's performance is a standout, but all the actors play their parts extremely well. It's hard to come away unaffected by Taxi Driver, and to me that's the mark of a great film. The Blu-ray edition looks great considering the age of this film, though it's obviously not as sharp as recent releases. This Blu-ray worked fine in my region B player. Taxi Driver is a psychological trip through an extremely interesting character study. Leaving viewers mystified, Martin Scorsese has crafted a superb movie. The script is audacious, the cinematography is in your face and gritty, and Robert De Niro's holds up the movie on his very own. Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a taxi driving nobody who has served in a Vietnam and goes to pornographic movie theaters, making small talk with the woman who sells the food and candy. The story never let's go off you (even the end will leave you haunted and wondering) and the lonesomeness of New York seen through Bickle is mesmerizing. It is filmed in such a way that allows you to see the world has the main character would, who thinks New York is covered with """"trash"""". Travis Bickle also narrates the story, making it emotional and more than just a one-dimensioned story. No one could have made this movie except Scorsese. Everything you would expect, the camera angles, settings and cast are done perfectly. What would be a classic without it's presentation?! This digipack special edition brigs a few cards within with pictures of the stars and movie scenes. The art is incredible! So as the picture and the soud DTS-HD-MA. This is the kind of movie that will evoke many different emotions from the watcher. This movie is not for the faint of heart. Any film by Paul schrader is ok with me. I love his work. This film gives me chills even to think about it. I have the soundstrack and can see the film in my head as i listen to it. I also bought the book. """"The making of Taxi Driver."""" It is amazing.

Hackman first plays nice and then plays cat-and-mouse with his new XO through the first half of the film, until the gloves come off and there's a direct ongoing confrontation between the two that crackles with energy.

I am sure that dogs and fishtanks are not allowed on subs, but they added to the entertainment. Also thankfully, no decapitations or torture. Also, no sex. This is a film about wars of wills on the micro and macro levels, which shows filmmakers that great tension can be built without extreme violence. And one can see how James Gandofini got the roll as Tony Soprano- great malicious facial expressions, worthy of a prince or a mafia don. love the movie Great movie. Anything with Gene Hackman in it is usually very good. He is one one the best actors of all time. As a United States Navy veteran, I can tell you that this could never happen in real life. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington, however, make this adventure incredibly believable (even in my eyes). Get to the edge of your seat as soon as you put the DVD in your player; and you'll remain there until the end! Great product.. Bought it so my teen son can see the life (however twisted) on a U.S. Navy Sub. He loved it! Very awesome, suspenseful movie with an excellent cast. good Really like the movie. good I love sub movies. very gripping. Good. A really good tense drama with just 1 too many plot twists. Denzel is great. always. This movie will keep you guessing. The film is packed with genuine 'tension' the world is on the brink of a nuclear holocaust,the sub's Captain 'Frank Ramsey' (Gene Hackman) is convinced the last order recieved gives authority for a devestating 'strike' ....but comunication is down, the number 'two' 'Lt Commander Ron Hunter' wants to wait for further communication which causes a serious split in the command chain. Taking over the heavily armed vessel becomes the only option left for the number 'two' and those that feel the same way. Both men have a point, but who's decision will turn out to be the right one ? 'Denzel Washington' and 'Gene Hackman' afford you some compelling viewing, this is such a good film, i've seen it several times before, but still wanted to watch it again on the 'Blu-ray' format,........... The picture and sound quality is good throughout. An excellent movie! Very nice. Thank you. Great movie with plenty of suspense. Delivery was quick. Thank you. Great movie """"Yeah, horses are fascinating animals. They're not too different from high school girls. They might not have a brain in their head... but they do know all the boys want to f*%^ 'em."""" """"Launch the f*&^ing missles."""" """"F#$% you!"""" """"This is my f@*%ing boat!"""" """"Not any f***ing more!"""" """"Bite your f*^&ing tongue."""" Brilliant screen writing there, boys... Capital job. Congratulate yourselves. You slipped the """"f"""" word or some variation of it into the script some 28 times, with each shtick-filled scene delivered with suitably DEFCON-4 apoplexy & juvenile rage. The only thing missing on the faces of the cast were pimples, but perhaps the Navy issues Clearasil in cursing school. """"F"""" this and """"f"""" that...oughta win you a Pulitzer. Do they give Pulitzers for screen writing? <Director: """"CUT!!! Who wrote this crap?""""> This could've been a great movie. Instead, it's not. The premise is good, but the dialogue is vintage illiterate 8th grade trash, and in its totality only achieves showing Navy officers and enlisted men as a bunch of foul-mouthed, hysterical, bordering on fanatical f*^#ing lunatics in charge of a significant number of nuclear weapons. We were rooting for the Russians in the Shchuka (i.e., the Akula class sub - now replaced by the far more advanced Severodvinsk) if only to end the ordeal and teach these punks some manners. Down right embarrassing or do foul-mouthed cursing coupled with childish tirades exemplify manliness in that man's Navy? Do svedaniya, comrades. Everything is perfect Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington, a great combo. And yes, the movie is superb. A must have in the collection, esp. on Blu-ray. Action aboard a Boomer. Very good acting and kind of suspenseful. Better than the Hunt for Red October good story Great actors I don't think officer training school can adequately prepare someone for the no-win situation, which I believe is at the heart of """"Crimson Tide"""". This film is not terribly complex in its storytelling but the theme of a decision-making dilemma aboard a nuclear submarine makes the entire experience extremely compelling from start-to-finish. It's one thing if orders from on high instruct a ship or sub to patrol a certain geographical location and those orders may have been recanted. It's quite another if the orders are to engage in a nuclear launch, and there is a question about whether those orders were rescinded. The story takes place on the USS Alabama, a United States nuclear submarine on the verge of a possible nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States. The title is a kind of play on words as it references the University of Alabama nickname, the Crimson Tide. Gene Hackman is perfectly cast as the hot-headed/don't-question-my-orders Captain Ramsey, top commander of the USS Alabama. On the other side is Denzel Washington as Commander Hunter, Executive Officer (XO) of the sub and Harvard graduate who has probably memorized the officer's handbook and military code. Ramsey probably hasn't seen the handbook in years, his decision-making prowess derived from experience on the high seas which began when Washington was in kindergarten. Even early on, Washington and Hackman seem somewhat at odds in the officer's lounge when Washington states that """"war is the enemy"""", while Hackman is bent on carrying out orders without question, and he expects his senior officers to give him the same courtesy. Hackman says during the same discussion that he studied military tactics, not 19th-century philosophy. The best line of the film is when Hackman states """"We're here to preserve democracy, not practice it."""" The two senior officers collide when at first the sub is given orders to launch their nuclear weapons toward Russia and then shortly thereafter receives a fragmented communication. The question posed is whether the initial communication should be honored and the fragment discarded or should the launch be delayed in order to obtain the second message in its entirety. But faulty communications prevents the sub from receiving further messages, and they are under attack from another enemy sub which knows their capabilities. The moral dilemma is as follows: If the nuclear weapons are launched and the order had been rescinded, the sub would be responsible for provoking World War III. If the orders to launch were confirmed by the second message, and the sub doesn't act, the United States would be compromised in terms of a nuclear exchange. The film becomes a power struggle between Washington and Hackman on the best course of action. A really engrossing film with not only outstanding performances by the top leads but a great supporting cast to match, including James Gandolfini (of Sopranos fame) and Matt Craven (A Few Good Men) as supporters of the captain, and George Dzundza (No Way Out) as the Chief of the Boat who reluctantly supports Washington. Honorable mention goes to Viggo Mortensen who has the combination to the safe which contains the nuclear launch device but can't decide who he sides with. The main thrust of the story is interspersed with interesting dialog, some of which has nothing to do with the situation at hand, probably provided by Quentin Tarantino who is uncredited. A perfect combination of action and drama within the context of a military thriller. Scarey Great movie that never gets old thank you It is Denzel Washington, what else can I say. Exciting classic movie. A must-have for your DVD collection. Lots of unrealistic dialog and scenes. Anyone who has been in the military - let alone the sub service - will recognize the stupidity of some of language and scenes. Love this movie as much as Hunt For Red October. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington go on a collision course.....SUPERB acting and suspense. Bravo. If you have not seen this sub movie you're living in a cave. Denzel Washington & Gene Hackman are magical. intense. Great drama and suspense right to the end, you know all will work out but many twist and turns happen before the end. Great exciting movie. Blue-ray is great. Great movie Birthday gift for Hubby! Such good acting and story line very good I just love the movie. Thank you for being so quick. great movie You can't watch this movie enough. There is always something you missed. This top character cast is fantastic and Gene Hackman, such a great man, played a part so out of kilter for him. Denzel Washington, though not used to him being so passive in here, after watching him on Man on Fire now, also commendable. However, hats off to Gene Hackman. Excellent movie, Excellent Purchase. great movie A little far fetched, This would not happen on U.S. nuclear sub. Hackman and Washington. You can't go wrong with that combination in a thriller/suspense movie, even if the story line is somewhat implausible. Good Movie I love it. It's very interesting. A mutiny occurs in a submarine over missile orders. All the actors were amazing. The storyline is good. I highly recommend it to all. Third time I've watched it! Thanks! fast shipping and all is god! Received as promised and very pleased! great flick So much action on a submarine ship with if we should go to war and send nuclear weapons Great movie I loved this movie oh great it was. The ship was very nice. Suspenseful submarine film with crew conflicts. Great Price!! Fast shipping!! Such a great movie. Denzel is so inspiring in it. very good delivery, video is great! good buy An excellent movie. It took me a long time to find it and I am not disappointed in any way. Thanks This is going to be a Christmas gift. I have wanted to see the movie for a long time Great movie! Good price. Great modern day classic. Outstanding acting by Hackman and Washington. Very realistic and believable due to the great sets, acting, costumes, etc. Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington"""	Crimson Tide
6175	"""With this sequel to his prize winning independent previous film  """"El Mariachi """" director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick  glamorized ultra violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of """"El Mariachi """" where an itinerant musician  looking for work  gets mistaken for a hitman and thereby entangled in a web of love  corruption  and death. This time  he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand  which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However  the plot is recapitulated  and again  a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count  involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord  and finally  the inevitable face to face confrontation and bloody showdown.

This movie will remain with me forever! I love the bar scene! Best part of the whole damn movie! Great movie with the same lady in this movie again. Pretty good movie with fantastic violence. Salma Hayek is simply gorgeous. Picture and sound kick... on DVD. This was a great action movie with a lot of bullets flying everywhere and some amazing action scenes paced throughout the film. Antonio Banderas brings back memories of Eastwood's """"Man with No Name"""" movies and does a wonderful job in the film. This film would make a fine addition to any action collection. This is one of those movies that made for great trailers in the theaters but fizzles fast when you watch it. There are maybe 3 bits in this movie that work. The best is Quenten Tarrintino's cameo. A lot was made of the violence but it looks mostly like 2nd rate John Woo. The action scenes don't deliver the tenseness necessary to get your heart pumping. This is because they look pretty but have no credibility,they're almost silly. Watch it for Salma Hayek(MMMMMm...Salma) or rent El Mariachi, the original and far superior film Leave your brain at the front door and your cynicism in the next county, because 'Desperado' is simply a comic-book action film, little more or less. Style is the order of the day, and Rodriguez provides it in spades, with all his cast backing him up marvellously. The Tarantino factor seems a little misplaced, substituting gore for the normally balletic qualities of the showdowns, but the presence of the actors pulls it off with style. Simply put, this movie is what it is - fantastical action/shoot-out stuff, with hardly a thought spared for realism. And that, in the end, will determine your reaction. But let's face it - it's a great ride. At the end of this review, some mention should be made of Ms. Salma Hayek. Insert your own thoughts here. This reviewer's jaw is still being fork-lifted from the floor. in my opinoin this is antonio banderas' best movi Rodriguez made a small film called """"El Mariachi"""" that was beautifully realized and made for under $7,000 dollars and now he gives us the """"now-that-I-have-enough-money"""" version. And it's beautifully realized. Somewhere between John Woo and Sergio Leone with a little Coppola and Tarantion thrown in for luck, this movie is a miracle of story-telling and style. This time, the Mariachi-Man(with a small arsenal in his suitcase) is played by Antonio Banderas(THE MASK OF ZORRO). Every scene that he's in is filled with violence and dangerous sexuality that makes him one of the most sought-after male leads in Hollywood. In the opening, Steve Buscemi(CON-AIR, FARGO, THE BIG LEBOWSKI) tells the story of a mysterious shadowy stranger who goes from bar to bar, looking for the man who destroyed his life. In the process, he shoots up everybody, including the bartender, much to the unease of 'tender, Cheech Marin(T.V.'s NASH BRIDGES, TIN CUP). You see he's part of the front for Bucho, played by Joaquin Del Alameida (ONLY YOU, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER), the man who killed Mariachi's woman. And Alameida is wonderfully cast as the baddie, being shadowy and sexy at the same time with a gruff voice and commanding eyes that you can read like a book. And so, the story rages on, and so does the mythology. Mariachi goes from place to place, trying to avoid being shot at in action scenes that look borrowed from the Universal Studios Western Stunt Show. In the process, Banderas meets Carolina, played by the beautiful Salma Hayek(54, THE FACULTY, FOOLS RUSH IN). She's eye candy, but instead of just looking pretty like most models in film(see CINDY CRAWFORD in FAIR GAME), she actually ACTS. Her character is complex, in that she is part of the Bucho's Front, so she understands the violence and the drugs. That's how she is able to fall in love with Banderas in the first place. And there's many contradictions that hide in this film(the Mariachi has one spur, not two; the movie is in the present, but there's a lack of any technology; the love scene with Banderas and Hayek is beautiful, whereas the cut to his enemy having sex is slutty and whore-ish, you are able to make out the contrast between good and evil) and in these scenes, Rodriguez handles things beautifully. Again, the love scene with Banderas and Hayek is a gorgeous standout. There are, what seems like a hundred lit candles in the room and the beautiful """"Bella"""" by Santana is played in the background. It's filmed slowly, passionately, and so romantically that you're almost hypnotized by it. It's the best love scene since the Snipe' neck-bite in BLADE. There are many surprises in this film that are worth mentioning, but I won't go into them. See this film for yourself, then rent """"From Dusk Till Dawn"""" and you'll have yourself a great American-Mexican Western-Fest in your own living room. --Matt Thanks My dad loves this movie!! Great flick! This is one of my all time favorite action movies, for it's great plot, great action sequences and incredible cast. And I do mean incredible. Banderas, Steve, Cheech and even Quentin are great. Banderas flawlessly portrayed his character, and the action sequences were outstanding. The four stars rating is in reation to the DVD, which was quite dissapointing. The picture quality is great, the 5.1 Sound is great, but extras? Good god, you cant even give us a trailer, Columbia? I would of killed for a Robert Rodriguez commentary track. The closest you get to any kind of an extra is the single quote by Robert that's featured in the DVD's booklet. Great Movie, Good DVD. Great action from beginning till end !This movie can never go out of styleclassic The cast and music in this movie made me want to smoke a cigar and drink whiskey while watching. I felt like I was in a Latino party the entire time as I watched the star studded cast with Salsa music and comedy throughout the movie experience. If you are a Cigar & Scotch Aficionado then this movie is definitely for you. none good movie Great double feature DVD. These two Movies are both great Movies. This is one you all need to have. Everybody will love both Movies. Boring and bloody- not worth the money or the time spent watching it. There are better Johnny Depp movies around, Great movies As I have told my co-workers and friends, these are both cult classics that one MUST have in their movie collection. Definitely worth the money! I would recommend buying From Dusk Til Dawn, because all of these movies connect somehow. Love it Great movie, in excellent condition. Really liked it Guns, guns, lots of guns, more guns, big guns, long guns, guns in guitars, rocket launchers in guitars, guns up sleeves, guns, guns guns. Couple of extra guns thrown in on the side. Oh and some dinky knives too. That about sums up Desperado really. Apart from the fact that it's a refreshingly well made Mexican revenge story, well shot and craftily edited by Robert Rodriguez. It's also extremely funny in places. Some bits are stupendously over choreographed and others are as naturally clumsy as you'd expect in bar fights! The good guy doesn't have infinite ammunition either! If you liked """"From Dusk Till Dawn"""" you'll love this film - classy, full of every gun under the sun and well acted. Enjoy. I am the type of guy who likes original stuff, if you've read any of my other reviews, you know. So when it comes to action flicks, I am hard on'em, if they don't have one-man-kills-twenty action, I won't like it. If they don't have gun battles, I won't like it. If there isn't a good plot, I won't like it. If it doesn't have humor on the side, I won't like it. And it has to be non-predictible and action that makes you laugh it is so cool, without that, I won't like it. I had a tough time finding a movie that fits this catagory until I saw a preview for 'Desporado' on another movie. When the preview was over I said """"That is the one."""" I sure was right. This movie has got it all, the most original plot (revenge), some awesome one-man-kills-twenty action, action that makes you laugh, more than enough humor(If it has Steve Buscemi in it, it has to be funny), a girl, and the big non-predictible action(tell me that a guitar case that is a rocket launcher is predictible)! Plus is has got a great cast with Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, and Steve Buscemi. So, if you like original action movies, see this movie, if you like other stuff see this movie, everbody, see this movie, this is the best movie there is and I am ashamed of myself for not knowing about it until one month ago. This movie should go down in history! With a bigger film budget and a well-known cast, Robert Rodriguez's """"Desperado"""" continues the tale of the Mariachi who was forced into a life of violence. The film is action-packed, suspenseful and quite humorous. Some of the action sequences are over-the-top, but then again that is most likely the point. The end result is a very entertaining action flick that resembles a modern day Western. The film is pretty much a sequel to """"El Mariachi,"""" only this time with well-known stars. The nameless Mariachi is still coping with the death of his girlfriend and is making due with his injured hand, but he has dedicated his life to wiping out big-time drug dealers. His mission is against a certain known drug dealer that runs the town with an iron fist. Knowing that his life is filled with hatred and vengeful wishes, the Mariachi totes a guitar case of ammo and fire power and won't think twice of using them when he's in a tight spot. It's only a matter of time before he gets to show the drug dealer his """"bag of tricks"""" personally. This was a very highly entertaining movie to watch. While it may not be a better film than """"El Mariachi,"""" it proves to be a very stylized action trip with more tricks to it then ever before. Rodriguez is able to use a higher budget and has a chance to do more with his film in a visual and action sense. Even with the special effects and outstanding shootouts, Rodriguez is still able to tell a successful story. Antonio Banderas is great as the """"Mariachi"""" and gives his role a certain type of coldness to it--but is still able to add a lovable and sensitive quality to character. It was great to see stars like Steve Buschemi, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, and Quentin Tarantino fill the screen with their unique talents. In fact, it was during the shooting of this very film that Tarantino told Rodriguez that he had to make another movie since he considered it a Western Trilogy. This would later on become """"Once Upon a Time in Mexico."""" The DVD has some cool extra features to offer. First, the picture looks great and the sound quality is more than decent. Extras included are an """"Anatomy of a Shootout"""" featurette, a sneak peak at """"Once Upon a Time in Mexico,"""" trailers, commentary from the director and more. The """"Anatomy of a Shootout"""" featurette was extremely interesting to watch as Rodriguez lays down the thought process to most of the stunning action sequences in the film. A pretty nice DVD package altogether, if you ask me. """"Desperado"""" is a more-than-entertaining action movie with an interesting premise and some fantastic characters. It's definitely a lot better than a good majority of the action flops that are out and about today. If you're interested in"""	Desperado

One every person should own, in my opinion. First of all I would like to point out that Leonardo did deserve the oscar for this movie long before Titanic was thought about. :) Although both movies were good, this movie was incredibly convincing. This is the first movie I associated with Johnny Depp, and he didn't let me down. We have Gilbert, basically stuck in a bad situation, working at a grocery store, having an affair, constantly having to answer for why his mentally ill brother is climbing the water tower or eating the cake in the fridge. If his brother gets in trouble, then his mother has to come into town to bail him out, which is more of an embarrassment for Gilbert because his mother is very overweight. The movie is very sad, and you will find yourself crying through a few parts of it. I love Juliette Lewis in this role too, a far cry from natural born killers, but she starts to show Gilbert that there is more to life. Once in awhile he has to ask himself what he wants out of life instead of taking care of everyone else. Absolutely wonderful! I love it! Touching story, well told, and well acted by two actors just beginning their careers. this is the best leonardo and johnny movie i have ever seen. leonardo should have won an award for his performance. Sometimes the best performance come in a film that just doesn't deserve them. Everyone knows of Gilbert Grape, but not because it is a classic film that deserves to stand the test of time, rather it is the film that launched two of the biggest careers in Hollywood. Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) is barely old enough to drink, yet he is the man of the house, forced to raise his brother and sisters, and care for his obese mother. Gilbert lives in the middle of nowhere, works a terrible job, and his future doesn't look so bright, that is until a girl, traveling cross-country with her grandmother, breaks down in his town. A relationship blossoms and Gilbert finally discovers that life has been passing him by. The story here is simple and at many points extremely slow moving. This film was just meant to be a backwards love story, but has become so much more, because of Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. The two young stars gave everything they had and more, with so little to work with, that their performances became absolutely legendary. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is not a good film, but you will be hard pressed to find one performance, must less two as good as the ones in this film. The feeling and emotion that come along with their joys and despair is something you just can't teach, either you have it or you don't. Both these actors will make you feel every emotion of their characters and make you take a look inside yourself in a way that few film will ever do. I hated the story, but I recommend this film for nothing else than it's performances. If every performance were as good as these, there wouldn't be a need to rate and review films. A lot of good performances in this one especially Leo held it all together and the time went by quickly. If anyone had to live Gilberts life I suspect running away would be a Prime Directive. A totally dysfunctional family manages to keep it all together and support a child with a major issue. Cant say its my favorite genre but I certainly enjoyed it and it didn't seem like a nearly 2-hour movie. There were some plot flaws like the whole disabled truck that mom repaired but you need something to anchor a few characters so therell be time the interaction between the two. Astonishing film. Great performances, especially from a young Leonardo DiCaprio. I actually thought that he was mentally handicapped. He should have won the Academy award and not just the nomination. The film also perfectly captured small town America. I felt sorry for Gilbert throughout the film. He was stuck in a miserable life, working at a small grocery store, having to watch over his dysfunctional family, and also having an affair with an oversexed and older Mary Steenburgen. Then Juliette Lewis entered the picture, I was hoping that he would run off with her, she being his only slice of sanity. I loved watching watching their scenes together. The first time I watched this film, I was turned off by it. Then I gave it a second try and I found myself involved with the characters. I found myself watching the film several more times and realized it was becoming one of my favorite films. This movie still holds up after all these years. Leonardo DiCaprio is just fascinating to watch, especially after seeing him in later roles when he is much older. This movie and his role in 'This Boy's Life' should have won him Academy Awards at the young age of 18/19 (the movies were made back-to-back.) Depp is good. There's really nothing to break this movie down in any way. As far as I can say, this is a perfectly made, perfectly acted, perfectly edited and excellent movie choice that you'll watch more than once! It's soooo good! Johnny, juliette, and Leonardo show how theirs talented is remarkable .dont stop Great film This is a film that inspires people of all ages, cultures, and sensibilities. Along with """"Groundhog Day"""", personally, this film is one to pull off the shelf when feeling down, and see what caring, giving, placing one's family above one's own wants and needs, ensuring all are as happy as they can be...be who you are, the best you can be though life sometimes never provides the right circumstances, though Gilbert is the person we SHOULD aspire to, because he's virtuous to the point where, the viewer cannot understand why he is so selfless, but hopefully, by the end of the film, will... Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, a Swedish filmaker agreed to do the film because of the novel by Peter Hedges who also wrote the screenplay. Together, these two men created a subtle drama where values, to be virtuous, to simply be a good person without realizing it, makes this film simply one of a kind. Johnny Depp as Gilbert is superb as the selfless giver, and carer of his mentally disabled brother, played with utter reality by Leonardo de Caprio. At the time, de Caprio was a little boy though received an Oscar nomination that launched this actor into a successful career, which has proved he has the right """"stuff"""" to portray anyone, a natural actor. One of the interesting casting stories is that Bonnie, Darelene Cates, `Momma"""", was not a professional actor, but chosen from the town where the film was shot. (What a beautiful presentation)! Later, particularly when, after not leaving her home for 7 Years, as she is morbidly obese, rescues her little boy from jail; what a performance, and her expressions as she leaves the jail while the crowd look at her as a freak is simply, well, moving. Becky (Juliette Lewis) is Gilbert's mentor, revealing that there is a big world out there and he should experience it. Lewis is gorgeous, another natural actor, where this film, again, launched her career as a special talent. This film is a subtle masterpiece, a film that shows the goodness of some human beings and the potential to see and experience the beauty of the world. A tragedy, satire, comedy, romance and reality all rolled into one. An astounding film. What is now so wonderful about revisiting WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE after several years, is to see multi nominated Oscar performers Johnny Depp,Leonardo DiCaprio and Juliette Lewis when they were on their road to stardom. WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE? is one of those incredible ensemble acting pieces that required JUST the right kind of actors. It is interesting to note that Depp,DiCaprio and Lewis have all, at one time, been listed as Hollywood's """"most intriguing actors""""!.This, to me, lies the greatness and the heart of this touching 1993 look at confused,repressed and quirky people in a dead Texas town called Endora! Take my favorite director Lasse Hallstrom (<a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/The-Cider-House-Rules-Miramax-Collector-s-Series/dp/B00003CWNR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">The Cider House Rules (Miramax Collector's Series)</a>,<a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Casanova/dp/B000EDWKXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Casanova</a>) and Oscar winning screenplay writer Peter Hedges (<a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/About-a-Boy-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JL7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">About a Boy (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Pieces-of-April/dp/B0000VV4OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Pieces of April</a>...he always writes, with great tenderness, very conflicted characters!), and VOILA, you have a look back in time when the """"great ones"""" were still yet to reach their pinnacle of success! GILBERT GRAPE has ALL the earmarks of that greatness to come. First off, if you have no patience with intimate films that have deliberate character development and no action, you may want to pass. If you relish great acting and a rising action story line, then read on! Gilbert is the second son of five on whom his entire family hangs! The oldest son flew the coup, the father committed suicide, the mother is a depressed obese and, the youngest son is a retarded boy who was not supposed to live, and the two sisters seem to have their own issues in life. Gilbert (expertly crafted by Depp) is the model of restraint and co-dependent behaviour as he cares for all of his family. But what is eating at Gilbert? He should be exploding any minute, but his feelings seem so repressed as he runs after his younger brother (DiCaprio- who received an Oscar nom),helps to deal with his Mother's depression and 500 pound+ obesity and also work in a dead end job as a grocery store stock boy. In fact, the only sign that Gilbert has any life in him, is when he delivers groceries to an older and married housewife (Oscar winner Mary Steenburgen,as only she could deliver this performance!)where Gilbert finds himself somewhat entrapped,but afraid to let go. Enter Becky, a passer-through Airstream trailer girl whose rig breaks down in Endora. It is this relationship that awakens Gilbert and the rest of the family to confront all of the repressed and suppressed feelings as a family that somehow functions. Every performance in this film is A+ and should be viewed for the quality of acting and adeptness at direction and screenplay. The Special Edition has wonderful interviews with the cast and director that give perspective of people who can now look back at the film and examine it with fresh perspective. One of the best Special Editions on DVD and well worth the $$$. One of these films that are an essential step in the career of an actor. It was true for Leonardo DiCaprio who got his first Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for the role of a differently-abled kid . It is true he does a good job in that part and he is a brilliant couple with Johnny Depp as his bigger brother. The film is entertaining though on many other levels. The survival of a small town in the US at a time when big shopping malls are opening everywhere. These small towns are doomed to die sooner or later. Their only chance is to become suburban development projects and become the home of people working in the big city next door who want to live away from the hectic activity of the city and commute there every day. We are before this development in Endora. The second interest is the fate of a family in which there is a mentally disabled child. Here they have no opportunity to provide him with an education and some professional activity. So he is more or less attached to a member of his family and he is haunting if not even worse that brother of his, as well as the police and neighbors.

Had been a long time since I had viewed them and still found them exciting. GOOD MOVIES no good movies in good shape Bought this double pack for both the movies. Clear and present danger was an awasome film. I enjoyed patriot games as well, although patriot games was a little slow moving for my taste Love Harrison Ford in these. Nice to watch when I feel like it. Very exciting movies. GREAT! This is a great way to pass the time. You can forget all your troubles, you will be glued to the television watching this movie There are some movies I just love to watch over and over! Harrison Ford, as always, is such a tremendous actor! It's exciting from start to finish! It's Jack Ryan and Harrison Ford, how can you go wrong? I must admit though that I enjoy Patriot Games better than Clear and Present Danger. I like Harrison Ford and enjoyed these movies a lot. I am a big fan of the author and I'm always interested to see how the vision of a director measures up against the author's intended story. These are both quite exciting and will keep the attention of the viewer from start to finish. Definitely worth having as part of any movie collection. This is my second copy of these movies. I wore the the first ones out. I look forward to receiving clean copies. Harrison Ford is the greatest. I love movies about politics and the mysteries therein. I am a Harrison Ford fan and enjoy his movies. This is not his greatest movie, but it is a good one. Sent when promossied package great Will be happy to work with this dealer again anytime thank you very much Micki I had to have these two movies - haven't seen 'em in years since I didn 't have the DVD version. Looking forward to some spare time so I can get them watched again!! Excellent movie. Best yet. Have always loved movies and music. This is the best! Thanks You always for giving me this. Wow!

Bergin gives an electrifying performance: violent, menacing, and played with a devilishly cold glint in the eyes. I was almost ashamed to say that I was proud to be an Irishman as I watched this movie! The rest of the cast, especially Samuel L. Jackson and Richard Harris, play their roles with aplomb. Technically, the film gets top marks. The score by James Horner is up to the maestro's usual top standards. The editing is excellent and the cinematography is quite often stunning. Phillip Noyce directs with style and a relevancy that was ahead of it's time. Patriot Games is often surprisingly effective, even if some of the outdated tech is often painful to watch. The action scenes are excellent, riveting, and realistic, with the Irishmen stealing the scenes, or rather, shooting them full of holes with an M16. Jack Ryan may not be as suave and impeccable chiselled as Bond; he may not know how to kill someone with a hand towel like Jason Bourne...but he has a moral compass, a strong jaw, a stronger right hook, and a sense of decency that, when it is frayed by evil men, can turn into fiery heat in a second. Combined with Tom Clancy's techno-centric, improbable but entertaining plots, Patriot Games is an above average spy thriller. My rating? 4.5 stars out of 5. P.S. Rest in peace, Tom Clancy. You wrote books so big they could be used as house bricks in an emergency. Your plots were so complex they needed alternate universes to make sense. Your Jack Ryan is one of America's favorite characters, because he represents the truth, justice, and American way that they strive for. You named one of your books """"Red Rabbit"""", which was brave, to say the least... You died too soon, so once again I say, rest in peace. I now turn to John le Carre to fill your empty hole, but I know the page count is too thick for it to be filled up... It is interesting how Harrison Ford replaced Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan in PATRIOT GAMES and that made PATRIOT GAMES' focus around Jack Ryan as the main character much stronger. That transaction seemed flawless and a natural one. Ford's interpretation is that of a thinking man and a man of action and one of integrity in both PATRIOT GAMES and A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. Anne Archer as Cathy Ryan in both films also strengthens the dynamics that she and her husband have a the screen. Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan is a family man and that strengthens his image of dedication to both family and country. I like both PATRIOT GAMES and A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER very much. There are very good scenes in both films. I always liked the scene in PATRIOT GAMES where Ryan stops the IRA assassination outside of Buckingham Palace. PATRIOT GAMES filmed in some really great locations. PATRIOT GAMES is one of Phillip Noyce's best directorial efforts. I thought Joaquim de Almeida as Colonel Felix Cortez in A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER almost stole the film with his performance, He has a very strong screen presence. There were also some very tense moments in A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. The one actor in all three films who always steels the scenes he is in was James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer. It really is great have all three films in one. I also like James Horner,s score for both films. His scored is really tied to the human side of the narratives and not the action. I love this whole series and own them all. great films great VERY GOOD SHOW, HIS MOVIES ARE NEVER WRONG OR TOO FAR FROM 5 STARS To graphic for my taste Bought as a gift DVDs so good. CLEARLY DOUBLE THE ACTION AND DOUBLE THE ENTERTAINMENT. HOW CAN YOU NOT OWN THESE TWO MOVIES AND OWN """"HUNTER FOR RED OCTOBER?"""" HARRISON FORD IS TOP DRAWER IN THESE. BUT YOU CAN'T OWN THESE WITHOUT PURCHASING """"SUM OF ALL FEARS?"""" WE ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING TOM CLANCEY'S NEXT WHITE-KNUCKLE-NAIL-BITER. Another action movie...and, of course, FABULOUS Harrison Ford! A great value here. Two Harrison Ford action movies in a combo-pack. Unlike others, each movie is on a separate disk and both come in separate cases. Harrison Ford takes over the Alec Baldwin character from """"The Hunt For Red October"""" in two follow-up stories by Tom Clancy. Among the very talented cast are James Earl Jones, Willem Dafoe, Sean Bean, Anne Archer and many other recognizable faces. Very Highly recommend. Great customer service and quality product Just what I wanted Who doesn't love getting two movies for the price of one. Would do business with this provider again for sure I'm replacing some of my VHS movies (yes - I'm really that old) with DVDs. These movies are worth watching over again every so often. Even though you know how it will turn out the cinematography is great and holds your attention. This movie pack is really good and is going to make a great gift for the movie buff in our family. Both items were as represented. I have already viewed both items. Lots of a action. Harrison Ford will always be """"Jack Ryan"""". Its hard to believe that so much time has passed since these movies released. Tom Clancy was at his peak with these and Harrison Ford was the perfect Jack Ryan; he wasn't the suave James Bond but more of the everyman who did what had to be done. These movies, while dated, hold up pretty well in terms of plot. Sure, they aren't as crisp as the latest blu-rays nor are they as action packed as the Bourne trilogy but what they are is great looks into the kind of plausible conspiracies and plots that keep you entertained every moment. Great for a double feature. Great movie. Great movies Clancy's work is outstanding I saw both of these movies when they came out in the movie theater. And I was very glad to see them on DVD. Both movies, """"Clear and Present Danger"""" & """" Patriot Games"""" are two of Tom Clancy's best novels. The movie script sticks to the books and Harrison Ford makes a great Jack Ryan. Shipped prompty by Amazon. Item as described. No complaints. Finish to my series. Awesome movies. Highly recommend. I like all of his films. We love Harrison Ford movies. Very enjoyable. Love the 2 movies Love it It's Tom Clancy. It's Harrison Ford. What could be wrong? I only wish Harrison Ford was Jack Ryan in all the movies based on Tom Clancy's book and that all Tom Clancy's books had been made into movies. Two great movies. A big fan on Tom Clancy novels and Harrison Ford does a good job playing Jack Ryan. I think both of these are excellent movies and Harrison Ford just really sells his character so perfectly. But no question, """"Clear and Present Danger"""" is the superior film. It's a thrilling, twist-filled adventure that is among the best films of its genre. The scene of Ford facing off with the President of the United States is worth the price of the dvd. """"Patriot Games"""" is also a good movie, interesting and fairly exciting, but it didn't have the impact on me that C&PD had. I bought this set because I wanted C&PD, but it was cheaper to get the set than to buy that film on its own. Go figure. Now I always look for multiple-movie sets if I'm buying a dvd. And by the way, I belong to Prime, so I can get quite a few good movies for free and recently I've been buying more blu ray discs than dvds, but I think now is a good time to collect inexpensive dvds (eventually they're going to go the way of VHS tapes). While Prime does have a good selection of """"free"""" movies, there are still huge gaps and lots of films you have to rent. If I'm going to pay to rent a movie, I'd rather just buy a used (or cheap new) dvd and have it on a shelf. Just a thought. Very good thinking movie. The best of the best actor and movies. My husband loved this gift. Harrison Ford does a great job in the role of Jack Ryan. Exciting DVD Some of his best acting by far. I think it was smart not to have him in Red October; and I don't care how it came to be. Great old movies and very entertaining, but maybe not for the younger kids. Always great buys through Amazon. Harrison Ford fans will enjoy. excellent"""	Clear and Present Danger

It has all three movies in Blu-ray and DVD and the original Lion King in 3D and the Digital Copy. Even the drum used to store the movies is cute, and my daughter loves playing with it. The only issue I had was the the Disney Movie Rewards code was not in my box. But, I was able to get my rewards points by emailing Disney and showing them my purchase receipt. Great Disney Movie set! I love the Lion King movies and really enjoy this set. I am so glad Disney decided to start offering movies in Blu-ray/DVD combo packs. It makes it easy to watch at home or in the car. I can't wait for more Disney movies to be released. My 4 year old daughter loves these movies! my kids love it... wonderful Love it. Best movie of my childhood so glad that I was able to get it and enjoy with my family I love having all movies right here! The only problem I have is that in order to get a movie out is a bit of a task. There is a box, and inside is another box, and in that box is an accordian-style disc holder with all the discs. The movies are all great quality and the box is truly a collector's package, but sometimes I wish I just had a regular box. We got it on a huge discount so it's all good! daughter loved this set, she screamed with glee when she opended it on Christmas. had lots of extras that she has enjoued Purchased this as a Christmas gift for one of my children and I was not disappointed, Lion King will live on forever! This is my all time favorite Disney children's movie and I loved this box set that it all came in. Great collector's item. Got this as a gift to my friend's child that loves the lion king. It is very nice and went over great. I would recommend. Love these movies! I really like it and made a family day with my kids and they watch again with they friend for sleepover. Good :) This is a wonderful movie.. We simply LOVE it. Awesome collection at a reasonable price :) Great movie for the little ones, could not get Disney movie reward points on this because it was code was only good for the UK Disney web site. very good. Product as advertised, promptly shipped. My kids love it. Recommended highly. Purchased this as a gift for my little nephew and he's never seen the movie (he's 5). After watching it, this is now his favorite! The set is great. To get all these movies in one case is great. Must have for Lion King fans. It's a must for Disney fans excellent and prompt service dvd's don't play This is one of those movies that I had to have but don't have any children. Of course, the first one is award winning. The rest,""""not so much"""". This os a awesome gift for my neice and she wanted to stay up all night to watch all of them, excellent addition to my collection Made for a great gift! Received very well! This is a great set to own. Only downside is it can get a bit pricey depending on who you buy it from. The 3D Lion King disk is stunning. The rest are also great. The drum and case set is artistically well made. Good! these movie will inspire you to keep going,to fight against all odds, to call on strength from your family history and unconditional love. it's a lesson in forgiving self and recognizing that you're called to be greater than what the negative people say. I've been searching for this set for a while. Thanks for the great price and prompt delivery. My daughter (13), my son and his wife, and my Grandchildren (5 and 2), and I just make a Family nite to watch all 3! Great movie, nice 3D effects lovely full HD details and the sound it is so realistic, nice packaging, fully recommended I'm amazed at how many negative comments there are ! 1) they speak on their behalf not yours ! And definitely not mine !! 2) don't let any negative comment dissuade you from buying it The case looks like a wood carved box and inside is beautiful and accurate african drum but not only that , a functioning drum !!! In the center is """"Disney the lion king trilogy """" - not in big letters but just right Open it up is amazing , but of course it's somewhat hollow - it has to be , it's a drum The littie wallet is so creative :) - looks like a lion and the Velcro straps look like ears not shaped like lion though ) It has sinbas sign on it Disney really took time on this one Decide for urself !!! LOVE These. THey have gave my family hours of entertainment! me and the wife watch with the kids as it was our favorite movie from kids and now its their favorite The 8 disc set of The Lion King is the perfect thing for any Lion King lover. it comes with all the movies and in blu ray formats too. that outside box looks like real carved wood and the bongo drum hold the movies. sure the discs holder could have been nice but it is still a perfect box set. the review has nothing to do with the movies because i've seen all the movies and i LOVE them! i give this four stars because it's a great deal... you get all 3 movies in bluray and regular dvd + digital copy and 3d disc! the only reason i didn't add that extra star was because of the packaging of the discs. i really wish the discs were in a better case. but at least they are in a little drum case. you'll just have to take care of your movies well. : all in all, it's great. This is one of Disney's worst Diamond Editions yet. You would think for as much as Disney is charging for the set they would make sure that all the bonus features are available to all owners. To access most of the classic features you have to be connected to the internet and get BD-Live. There are no games or activities on the movies. I think Disney should have worried less about putting Lion King in 3D and paid more attention to bonus features. If this is the best animated movie of all time I would think Disney could have come up with more features, or at least included all the classic features. I am giving this release a 3 star because the movies look great despite the lack of features. By the way for those of you wondering, the Lion King is the original theatrical release. In order to see the Morning Report you have to go to bonus features. FINALLY! The LION KING sequels have been a longgg time coming to blu-ray, but the wait is over and this wondrous set even throws in the original movie as a bonus! I only paid about $55. for mine only because I am a disney movie club member, and I pre-ordered this with the Pirates of the Caribbean, so with my member discount it brought it down to $53. something... anyways, you get the lion king 1, 1 1/2, and 2 in blu-ray 3d, which i probably won't use since 3d isn't installed on my tv, blu-ray, dvd, and digi copy of all them :) That's like 9 copys of the movie in a disc format and then 3 digi copys for your ipod or whatever movie device you own... I am very anxious to receive mine. Update: I was wrong... here is what's included... - THE LION KING 4-Disc Set With Blu-ray 3D(TM), Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy - THE LION KING 2: SIMBA'S PRIDE 2-Disc Set With Blu-ray and DVD - THE LION KING 1 1/2 2-Disc Set With Blu-ray and DVD All 3 movies are on blu-ray and dvd, however only the lion king 1 is on blu-ray 3d and digital copy... shame they should all be digital copy's, but guess you can't have everything... Still a great value. Update: Just received mine in the mail today... Good movies and everything, but bad case... The box and drum is good to keep them in, but it is nothing but cardboard for the blu-ray/dvds... That is crappy :( They should switch that and then it'd be good :) I just ordered the 4-disc Lion King set which includes the 3-D version on Blu-ray, 2-D version on Blu-ray, the Extras probably on DVD (but could be on blu-ray) and the 4th disc (Digital Copy) definately on DVD. I followed the link to the """"Blu-ray"""" Lion King Trilogy and read the reviews. Seems like everyone thinks all three films are in 3-D or 2-D and that all 3 films are in the Blu-ray format. Time to get this corrected or those who might order this set thinking all 3 films are in 3-D and on Blu-ray. ONLY the first LION KING is on Blu-ray with 3-D and 2-D versions. The (two) sequels are NOT Blu-ray discs so they are NOT high-definition. They are the same discs you probably purchased years ago because if Disney was going to spend the money to remaster them they'd add 3-D to them even if the 3-D is artificial as the last two weren't filmed in 3-D. Also these last two films are NOT 3-D either, but only 2-D. To me this deal is simply not worth the money Amazon is asking and actually, even if you don't own the (two) sequels already on DVD, they are over-priced should they cost over $5 each. And (for people like me) Digital Copies are utterly worthless. I have an Apple Ipad 2 and you can't transfer them to an Ipad (which is the only size screen to be able to watch the movie on a trip and be able to enjoy the movie properly by being able to actually see what's going on on the screen. Ipods or Iphones are simply too small to enjoy a movie on. So I simply throw the Digital Copies I get away. I would rather have a real DVD instead of Digital Copies with the Blu-rays so at least I can loan the dvd out to friends who don't yet have blu-ray. Also the extras on Lion King 1+1/2 and 2 are most likely on the same disc the movie is on. So the disc count now would be 1) LION KING 1 (4 discs), 2) LION KING 1+1/2 (1 dvd disc), LION KING 2 (1 dvd disc) which equals 6 discs. Now add in Digital Copies for the 2 last films and that equals 8 discs TOTAL. I gave this set only 3 Stars instead of 5 because the whole set isn't in Blu-ray high-definition. If THE LION KING 4-disc set is as good as every Disney 3-D release I will give it 5 stars. Re-check the disc count Amazon states comes with this set and I think you'll find there is only 8 discs total. I just wanted to make sure everyone knows exactly what they are getting when/if they order this set so no one gets disappointed. I know I'd be very disappointed if I ordered this and found the majority of the discs are only DVDs! Hope I was of some help to you. Lion King is, without a doubt, one of the finest films that Disney has ever produced. It has a moving story with profound themes - the passage of power in a royal household, the loss of innocence, the enduring strength of love - and a wonderful array of colorful characters.

From the beginning to the end, the movie didn't allow you to breathe, there's always something happening. The elevator opening scene provided a sort of prologue for the movie. And yes the movie gets even more exciting the following minutes. The bulk of the movie focused on Keanu Reeves attempt at preventing the bombing of a public bus by being actually on the bus. That was just pure fun, you've got all the possible roadblocks (traffic, broken bridge, gasoline etc) to keep the movie going. And then there is the closing scene in the train that serves as sort of epilogue for the movie. The movie wrapped things up quite well. When all the action was done, the movie actually ended in a postponed and obligatory romance between Reeves and Bullock. Engaging performances from everyone, tight and skillful direction from Jan de Bont, exciting stunts, and some funny moments! You can't go wrong with this movie. Grade: A- We usually tend to buy movies we don't mind watching over and over through the years, instead of just buying to watch once and be done. With that said this is one of those movies. We loved this movie when we were younger and still do today. Keanu and Sandra played wonderfuly off each other and the action was great. One of those we didn't wanna end! Product was delivered with no problems as well. This is a favorite movie of mine. I watched it previously and just watched it twice in the last few days. While as always, there are plot inconsistencies, but they do not detract from the pleasure of the movie. Dennis Hopper plays the bad guy who wants adn believes he is entitled to $3.7 million in retirement pay. The movie is in 3 parrts. First Hopper is trying threatening tp kill a bunch of people in an elevator. Blackmail on Hopper's part to get the $3.7 million. Kenu Reeves as Jack Travel and his partner stop him and believe they have killed him. However, Hopper survives and next threatens to blow up a fully loaded bus in the second phase. Bacause Hopper wants Jack T dead and his money, there are two goals his time. The gurgeous Sandra Bullock tranformed into the bus driver. Eventually after many excitements, Hopper is stopped again, although the $3.7 miillion is paid. Reeves and Bullock are falling in love. The third phase is Reeves, Bullock and Hopper on a subway train. Reeves and Bullock survive a train crash. And the ending is Rreeves and Bullock getting all mushy (as Bullock says), I highly recommend the movie for anyone who likes bad guy provding a lot of action with a substanial love interest. A classic Keanu Enjoyed this movie very much. I used to own """"Speed"""" on laserdisc, but then 10-12 years ago I made the final switch to dvd and got rid of my laserdisc player and the last of my discs. Among them """"Speed"""", which I never got around to buying on dvd and that's a crying shame, since """"Speed is one of the finest action movies ever made - and coincidently the movie more than any, that made the careers of both Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, catapulting both to instant super-stardom. Now - finally - I have come arund to buying a copy on dvd, and the movie hasn't faded even a bit. Not much in the form of special-features though. But never mind. """"Speed"""" is the story of 2 tac-team cops, a beautiful girl, a mad bomber..... and a BUS. Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and partner (Jeff Daniels) are called to a highrise building, where the mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) is holding 13 people hostage onboard an express elevator, threatening to blow the clamps, preventing the elevator from falling, taking the 13 people inside to their deaths. The cops manage to rescue the hostages though, which our unpleasant psychopath takes rather personal, since it prevents him from collecting the 3,7 million dollars, he was demanding. He escapes the building by faking his own death in a massiv explosion. He doesn't stay dead though, but rather returns with a vengange. He hijacks a city bus full of passengers, plants a bomb set to go of if the bus slows to a speed below 50. It's now up to Jack Traven to board the bus and keep it above 50, while his partner tracks down the bomber, who turns out to be an ex-cop by the name of Howard Payne. Did I mention that by a twist of fate our young wildcat Annie (Sandra Bullock) ends up behind the wheel of the bus?! Things don't go as planned though and Traven's partner ends up dead. And Paynes comment to the unfolding of events: We all know he was the brains of your particular operation. In fact the movie has quite a few memorable one-liners, so here are a couple to end my review: I'm smarter than you. I'm smarter than you. Yeah, but I'm taler. I got this dvd for my oldest son because he love buses he enjoyed it he likes action filled movies Good action flic. fun action movie A crazed guy has put a bomb on a bus and a policeman has to figure out a way to solve the situation,and save the passengers, and get the bad guy. Engaging vehicle story. Great storyline and action! Pleasure to watch many times. Even better in blu Ray. Great movie.. Keanu is the best Great movie .... highly recommend. Thanks. good movie A real good movie. It's an old one and I have seen it many times in the past bud I had to purchased it. Loved Keanu Reeves in this fast paced gripping story! Good. Very satisfied I have always liked this movie and bought the DVD to replace my VHS copy. PERFECT SCRIPT This is the film that made Keanu Reeves a bankable action film star. Of course, it was overdue anyway, based on his stellar performance in Point Break a few years before, but this was the one that lit him up like a Christmas tree on the pantheon of Hollywood somebodies. The plot is simple yet imaginative; an ex-cop demolition expert with a grudge decides to put a busful of hostages at risk by rigging it to explode if its speed goes below 50 miles an hour. So place these people (including a reluctant Sanda Bullock as the drafted designated bus driver), add Keanu as the cop trying to keep the busful of civilians straight and catch the bad guy (played well by Dennis Hopper)and Jeff Daniels playing the other cop trying to figure out the demolition angle from back at the station, and you have all the ingredients for a terrific and very entertaining movie. Which, of course, it is. It is unusual, very well acted, and the action sequences simply steal the movie. There is very little down time in the movie, and like the early Jaws, one finds oneself reeling from the action as it goes literally from one situation to another. The way the action scenes are choreographed and plotted makes one want to run for cover as the bus screams through a bevy of hairy circumstances one would think are going to doom it and the passengers to a fiery death. Suffice it to say that this is well worth your time and money, and that this new DVD version has a lot of added features regarding the film that make it even more fun to enjoy. Sit down and get your popcorn ready folks! The film is about to roll. enjoy! It was unbelieveably great! I love this movie so much, I want to get it naked, heh. This movie is justifiably famous for its nonstop action sequences, which are carefully filmed, directed and edited. I admit to being on the edge of my seat at many points. Dennis Hopper is, as usual, over the top in his role as a psycho former cop using terror as a way to get money he thinks is coming to him as compensation for injuries. We like to see Dennis in this type of role; we expect it, and thus are not disappointed. The supporting cast is good. Reeves and Bullock, around whom the subplot of a developing love relationship centers, probably do as well as they can with their lines. Bullock seems more at ease. Reeves seems a bit wooden. But the love subplot struck me as incredibly corny; it was extensive enough for me to dock the movie a couple of stars in the rating. This movie was good but the storyline was so dumb. I mean their couldn't have been one guy doing multiple acts on people without someone else helping him. This movie was also the start of the no story to special effects movies leading into such movies as Independence Day and Twister. Released in 1994 this movie made much money at the box office and unfortuantley started a trend that we still are in movies with no plots or anything to them, that is why there is an independent movies surge. If you like action this is the movie for you but the story is unbelievable. This and Die Hard are my two favorite action movies of all time. Keanu Reeves did a great job. Dennis Hopper also did an outstanding performance. My favorite part is when Jack is fighting with Howard Payne on top of the train and Payne gets his head.....never mind I'm not going to spoil it for those haven't seen it. Rent this movie on video or DVD. I assure you that you'll enjoy it... Keanu Reeve's , Sandra Bullock , and Dennis Hopper star in this blockbuster hit that insn't the ordinary run of the mill action film thank god. L.A. Police detective Jack Travin has been called out to stop a mad extortionist bomber played by Dennis Hopper who demands millons of dollars. When this happens Speed shift's into overdrive with a race against time and through the street's in scenes that easily rival Bullit or the French Connection , because all of the driving stunts are done with real busses 10 to be exact even a stunt where a bus jumps over an incompleted 50 foot gap and by then i'd say that the filmakers have easily overrivaled other car chase movies because simply this movie has made a new statement for them , but that's not all, the bomber takes a hostage the bus driver played by Sandra Bullock by taking her aboard a subway train and a fight sequence and an out of control subway train climaxes the film. When Speed is all said an done Jean De Bont carries his film well giving us a memorable action film with unexpected romance crowd pleasing thrills and a ride that you wan't to take much more than once. This new two disk set has anything you ever want to know about Speed and then some and with a Dts soundtrack now Speed will sound more like your on the bus rather then just watching it if you like action movies or car chase movies then Speed is a classic you should definately add to your collection. Pure fun. Keanu's boss gets the best lines. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed """"Speed"""" until I saw it again in its newest DVD transfer. Forget about the plausibility of the plot, since if that were the standard to judge action/adventure movies, how many would qualify? Instead, enjoy the non-stop excitement, with """"Armaggedon""""-type pacing where each solution is followed by another problem. The movie is basically all-action, all the time, and that's what those of us who love this genre want. If you're looking for profound dialogue or character development, you won't find it, but you will find lots of humor thrown in to lighten things up. Keanu Reeves gives a glimpse"""	Speed
6376	"The story of Wyatt Earp as he interacts and battles other famous figures of the Wild West era.Western , biographical biography biopic factual gunfight historical oscar-(best-cinematography) western ,""Wyatt Earp is best remembered for his life in Tomstone and the gunfight BEHIND the O. K. Corral. Dennis Quaid was great as Doc Holliday. Val Kilmer was Great as Doc in Tombstone. I want the Tombstone Legend Wyatt Earp. That is just my own personal opinion and you can disagree, but I've watched both movies and I enjoy Tombstone more. But Dennis Quaid is GREAT as the DOC in this Kevin Costner movie. Slow, wasted opportunity, I expected better from this actor. Tombstone is a much better version of this story. See them both and form your own opinion! This movie is not as good as tombstone, but it will work. If you like westerns then you,ll love this I like Kevin Costner but some of his movies can be too long. His teaming with Lawrence Kasdan (Silverado) would seem to me a match made in heaven. Unlike (Dances with Wolves) which was a story set during known historical events and told in a fresh way, Wyatt Earp is a retelling of a story most of us know or think we know. Good cast and authentic settings make for a nice look. It may be an accurate biography but not the most interesting. The section when he was a buffalo hunter may be historically correct but unnecessarily long as were a few other segments. As a history lesson, it may hit the mark but as a feature film, it left something to be desired. All time favorite. ...action packed, characters were awesome. ..This movie will leave you feeling as if you just left the movie theater If you like Kevin Costner, you will like this movie. The history of Wyatt Earp and the story behind is acted out very well by the actors and actresses. I recommend it. Love Kevin and he has great acting skills. Good cast as well. Wyatt Earp is a modern version of an old story told many times. For me it lacks the luster of originality and the old west. Numerous signs with this like the modern forks, clean clothing, and dialogue are drawbacks. There are other issues. Maybe they should have read a few Louis L'Amour novels before the production. I would have given it 3 1/2 stars but no designation. I wish Amazon would use a 10 star rating chart. Dennis Quaid is an exceptional actor but pales to the Doc Holiday played by Vail Kilmer in Tombstone. Although, Wyatt Earp is good entertainment. Enjoyed the movie it was long but very informative. It was interesting to see Wyatt's early life and what apparently led him to the life he lived in the west. the best earp movie on the market this is good cowboy movie - a little long a times but still a good movie to watch when its raining out Very good movie with great acting and mostly historically accurate. At 3 hours its way too long. Some sections not necessary for the story. While this is a good film, it had the misfortune to be released almost at the same time as its rival. I love kevan Costner and was surprised how slow and boring this movie is. I would not recommend it to friends. a very long movie.interesting and keeps your attention if you are into western.gotta love doc holiday -he has a great sense of humor in the movie.dont know if he did in real life. very good and well done While not fully true tothe story of this leggends life, you do get the flavor of the legend and the turmoil of the era. I have visited Tombstone multiple times, been to OK corral. It is a real place at the graveyard will point out. The bad guys are all there! this film actually used Earp's early life , the historical one. very close to facts know. good pace and action i enjoy histotry of the west. and this is as close as it gets i believe This was a good movie with a lot of stars. It clearly is worth watching, but it is very long. All of my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film's transfer from Standard Def DVD to the higher standard set for Blu Ray. Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant. The film's historical accuracy has been subject to debate, but then so was the accuracy of the much superior film 'Tombstone' with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer. Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65"""" plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective. VIDEO QUALITY..... The video for the 192 minute version of Wyatt Earp on Blu Ray (this is not the extended version I have been told is available on the Standard Def DVD) is one of the more uneven Blu Rays I have ever seen in terms of imaging quality. Most of the day time scenes have fairly decent and natural color grading and contrast and yet other day scenes display a smoothing of details and various degrees of deep blacks. Some scenes show blacks that are impressive but most of the time the blacks often take upon a grayish color grading. Night time scenes have an unnatural, overly cool blue color grading with a significant loss of detail where there needn't be. It is somewhat unusual to see such unevenness and lack of consistency in a Blu Ray's imaging. I noticed no dropouts or disturbing artifacts for this disc but it was quite clear to me that there was no remastering for Blu Ray either; it was simply re-encoded to Blu Ray with an Mbps average rate in the high teens. While the video is very watchable, its variability in blacks, details and skin tones was completely noticeable. AUDIO QUALITY.... A Blu Ray DVD with a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is almost unheard of for Blu Rays. The only other one that comes to mind is 'Goodfellas' and, for both, it is criminal. You are paying for the highest quality and not getting it. While the lossy audio codec being used is perfectly listenable, we would have gotten much more for our home theaters systems with a lossless audio codec. That said, the dialogue was easy to discern with volume levels quite consistent. During the first 70 minutes of the film the front audio stage, while mostly steered through the center channel, still had some nice panning and foley fx to the right and left surrounds as well as some discreet foley fx that were nicely separated. The rear surrounds and LFE channel were not used at all that I could hear. Actually it almost made me jump when, finally, a foley came through the rears almost half way through the film. During the second half of the movie there were a few more uses of the rear surrounds and a lightning storm woke up the sub channel producing good but not very deep bottom end. The music score provided a wide stereo image across the front audio stage but, to my mind, sometimes overshadowed and stepped upon what should have been discreet foley audio fx. EXTRAS..... There were a great many deleted scenes that probably were included in the extended version. In addition to the typical movie trailer, there was also a documentary 'Making of' that I didn't particularly find very interesting. I have read a great deal about the Earp family and the history behind the Earp legend and a historical featurette on this would have been welcome. To be honest, I am glad I only paid $7.99 for this Blu Ray as it clearly was not properly prepared for its blu ray transfer. I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well. Thanks for reading. I've seen so many Wyatt Earp movies that what I could see of it due to the fact it was HD I found very boring We thoroughly enjoyed this very entertaining and well written movie and acting by Costner and others was good as well. If you like western movies you will enjoy this film. The movie held my attention from the beginning of the story until it was finished. The plot was based on struggles that the family had encountered and what they were forced to do in order to survive. I rate it as PG or the next level. Kevin Costner does a good job as Wyatt Earp. According to historical records, Wyatt was fearless and humorless. He also does a good job of aging through the film. A minor problem with this film is that there are photographs from the 1880s of the Clantons and the Lowerys, and the actors in this film look nothing like these guys. If the historical character was fat, why make him skinny in the film? There are other historical inaccuracies in the film but not so gross as to ruin the entertainment value. This is a movie for lovers of Westerns, and the Wyatt Earp saga. It was difficult for me to keep up with as characters moved in and out to where I didn't always know who the bad guys were. They also jumped around to a few towns looking for greater opportunities and I couldn't tell what they were doing once they arrived there. They could be dealing cards one minute then running to a problem with their badges on the next. Lastly, Doc Holliday's character was over played. He was actually a fairly quite cerebral person who had the fastest gun around. it was a good movie 0 skips 0 jumps it was a good movie had no problems with it exelent This is a classic epic biopic on the Earp family. People often compare it to Tombstone which I can't help but do as well. But they are so different - this one being the slower-paced, long-winded tale. If you like Kevin Costner then you'll enjoy this one. I've always like Kevin C - he can play any role but he's especially good in this one. Was a little long and any history buff knows this is not the true story....W.E. only gain notoriety (wasn't always the upstanding lawman) after the book was published way back when....but enough about the history lesson. The movie was excellent because of the casting - Gene Hackman and all the """"Mrs"""" Earp's fit perfect. Costumes and setting are excellent again....enjoy it on night when nothing is good on the tube (which is like....every night) Has some turns you didn't see coming and will enjoy....great job Kevin!! What makes a good western movie? One, it must have a solid story line. Two, it needs to have great scenery depicting the """"old west."""" Third, it should have a mix of action and intrigue. Four, it needs experienced actors. Finally, it needs to stand by itself and not be a recapitulation of a former movie. Wyatt Earp meets all the criteria. Excellent movie with breath-taking scenery on the Blu-Ray disk. Dr. Horn From director Lawrence Kasdan (writer of """"STAR WARS Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"""" & """"Raiders Of The Los Ark"""") comes an in-depth look at Wyatt Earp, the main participant in the famous """"Gunfight At The O.K.

The almost-true story of Le Ly Hayslip, it is a beautiful, compelling story of a peasant girl caught up in the madness of the American/Viet Nam war, not knowing which side to take and ultimately attempting just to stay alive and find some happiness. Almost-true, because her amazing story needed to be condensed into a two and a half hour feature film. Three men became one, years became weeks and vast sections of her life were neatly trimmed away. This is understandable in any biographical film, but the result her is not so fluid as in other movies of this type. Also, an odd decision was made to film the movie entirely in English, except when interacting with American soldiers when they slip into a sort of broken English. Having the film be in Vietnamese, with subtitles, would have made for a more authentic experience. Tommy Lee Jones' character, the three men condensed into one, jumps too quickly from Hero to Monster to Victim, and one seeks for the core of his character in the movie. Who is he? It is difficult to tell. Hiep Thi Le as Le Ly is also confusing, at one minute the innocent, wide-eyed girl looking to be loved and the next a sophisticated businesswoman who is willing to sacrifice everything for success and money. As seen in """"Evita,"""" this kind of transformation isn't impossible to tell but here it doesn't seem honest. One looks for the sophisticate in the peasant or the peasant in the sophisticate, and doesn't find them. In spite of these criticisms, there is enough right about """"Heaven and Earth"""" to make the film enjoying and captivating. Telling the American/Viet Nam war from the point of view of the Vietnamese people is a jarring juxtaposition, and something I have never seen done before. Such a daring feat would be almost impossible in today's political climate of the US. Le Ly's story takes her through all walks of life and many aspects of the war, giving you something to think about at each stage. The cinematography is beautiful, and the colors and textures of Viet Nam make it seem like a paradise. The paradise is shattered by wars, with the green rice being overrun by the green tank and soldiers. In such a situation, it is difficult to tell who is right and who is wrong, with each side putting guns to your head ordering you to believe their ideology. I am glad to see this version of the DVD being released, with Hiep Thi Le on the cover instead of Tommy Lee Jones. Good as he is, he is in only about 30 minutes of the film, and certainly doesn't deserve the cover. I can relate to this movie and find it extremely moving and correct as I met my wife while serving in Vietnam and had to return in 1971 to complete paperwork enabling My Wife and 3 month old Daughter to return to Australia with me and start a new life in Australia. We have had our ups and downs over the last 40 years so as I said it is very easy for me to understand what the Vietnamese felt the way they were used and treated by both sides even those that worked as Bar Girls those that had sex for money in a lot of cases they were mistreated by the Soldiers paying for this pleasure as to many they had come in from operations and these poor girls become the enemy they have just been fighting and all their aggression is taken out on the girls, also the girls in doing this bring dishonour on their families back in the villages. At the end you see how during a war a brother can be on one side and the sisters are exploiting the Soldiers and they both end up in America also the mother wishes she had never sent her son away to fight with the Communist army to me they were a family in the middle and not believed by either side. I enjoyed it I am rather happy that it is not in the Vietnamese Language as I'm not sure that My Wife would appreciate it as much as the other Vietnamese Language movie's recently purchased Regards and enjoy Tony Green heaven and earth is a beautiful, but sad look at a war and turmoil. i saw this movie long ago and i still watch it over and over again. you can't help but get caught up in this film. about a man who all he knows is to fight, and this woman who must do what she can to survive. he's from america and she's from a whole other world. a world where food is scarce, war is everyday life, and where you don't know when you'll live or die. a place a woman called home and her own, until one day the war touched them and destroyed their land. her and her family had to learn to do what they must to survive. her brothers went off to fight, she became a part of this war, doing what she could to help her people. they suffered, she suffered, always knowing she could be the next to die. she learned to love only to be tossed aside left vulnerable and to fend for herself. she did what she had to for survival. then she met this man, a man of war of the opposite side. an american, who was captivated by her from the start. they found a brief moment of happiness and they made a life together. they did the best they could. when it was time for him to come back to america she followed with their children in tow. things got worse not better. their cultures crashed, their nightmares wouldn't leave them alone, and it was a relationship meant to crash and burn. she had fought a war in her country and here in america she was fighting a whole different kind. he needed mental help and she just couldn't deal. a movie with so much insight, and so much to give, it's hard to walk away not remembering it. this woman goes through so much and all she ever wanted was peace and love. it's these kinds of movies that you never want them to end. oliver stone did it again. it deserves an honorable mention no doubt. joan chen, the starring actress did a great job. as for tommy lee jones, he was excellent. he's one of my favorites. there's something about this guys attitude that you can't help but like. overall a very good movie. what more can i say had been wanting this movie for awhile and came up with a good price arrived on time Like most information rich Oliver Stone Movies - must be viewed three times. First, just watch the movie and its movie sound track. Second, watch the movie while listening to the commentary track. Third, watch the movie and its movie soundtrack a second time - now knowing the background information of the unexplained images that you now see - to understand in depth everything that transpired. Oliver Stone movies are generally very well researched and there is a lot of information in the images of the movies that you either already know about from your own knowledge, life experience, or you become informed about when listening to the move commentary. Like most of his movies, there is an issue cutting a movie to get close to the 1.5 hour attention span limit that Hollywood has determined. This one even goes a little longer than Hollywood might like. This movie is a sleeper in that, as explained at the end of the commentary track, it was released in theaters roughly at the same time as the movie Schindler's List. Plus movie goers are not able to listen to a commentary track. It might also be difficult at that time, for some to view a real life Asian perspective to the Vietnamese conflict. Just as in Schindler's List, depending on your perspective, is another real life story and a compelling look at the ROI of warfare capitalism. As Oliver Stone was a combat GI in Vietnam, his own story chronicled by Charlie Sheen's character in his movie Platoon, he has a deeper understanding of that conflict and that country as seen both through his own eyes as a young American GI. Later through the eyes of a young Vietnamese girl - the main character of this film. This Vietnamese girl came up in a country in conflict. She first helped the Vietcong, then scratched out a living off the edges of the war business, then married an American GI (Tommy Lee's Character) and moved to the US. Complete culture shock. This movie is fascinating on many levels. War plays a part, but is not the main conflict. The conflict in this movie is more on a personal and spiritual level. You will think about this one after viewing. I would call it Stones second best - first being JFK and second being Nixon. Just my two cents Price is nonsense as long as you can get the disc from Twilight Time for 30$. Also, the transfer provided by Warner Brothers is technically screwed up (incorrect conversion of 1080i to 1080p adding jaggies to all edges) and needs to be redone. Same as with some other WB titles that were screwed up the first time around (The Fugitive, Enter the Dragon...). Got it for my wife I never seen it but my wife loves this movie !!! Great story, good acting. Good This movie follows one girl's life before and after the Vietnam War. This movie is both beautiful and sad. You watch as this simple farm girl has many hardships and adversities she must overcome. You get drawn into this movie you start fighting for the character to survive. You want her to overcome all obstacles. I truly enjoyed watching this movie. It made me remember how lucky I am and how unlucky I could be. This film is a bitterly heartbreaking story that is often incredibly painful to sit through. Sobering and realistic, This true story follows a young vietnamese girl and her family torn apart by the horrors of war and chaos. This is about the scars of war, the remnants of war, about those directly and indirectly effected by war. Forced to fight for the VC brigades for a time, then against them at another, this young girl was raped, tortured, despised by her own village and seen as a traitor. Her story is only one of many such stories. Young women caught in the middle of death and horror so unbelievable that it seems very hard to comprehend to those of us who have never experienced such agonies. She meets a soldier played by Tommy Lee Jones who merely wants to find someone to embrace and care for. He takes her and her one very young child to live with him in america. Jones by the way gives such a powerful, touching and painfully honest performance as a man filled with love who cant come to terms with the horrors he was forced to commit in the time of war. His performance left me breathless, utterly breathless. The pain and utter feelings of ruin his performance delivers is freightening and truly heartbreaking. It had me in bitter tears. Indeed I cried through most of the the last half of this film. Its a very sad and painful story but also truly touching at the same time. It takes a bit of time to get used to the rythem of the film and the feel for the acting. Particularly people who are supposed to be playing Vietnamese villagers all speaking in clear english. But after awhile it grows on you. It was also nice to see Haing S. Ngor"""	Heaven Earth

Just turn off your brain and enjoy. I mean you've gotta love a Martian atmosphere restored in a few minutes. Real or no real? Real good deal on these two fun films. Ok Two great old movies. I generally try to resist rebuying updated special editions, or Blu-ray versions of a film that I already own, but once in a while I make an exception. In this case it turned out to be a pretty good decision, as the Terminator 2: Judgment Day/Total Recall Blu-ray two pack is economically priced, and features some decent looking transfers of two of Arnold Schwarzenegger's action classics. Of the two films, the Blu-ray of Terminator 2 (1991) is more impressive, as the image quality is more vibrant and sharp. While the disc isn't loaded with extras, you do get a 2003 commentary by director James Cameron and William Wisher, as well as a cast commentary from 1993. This is the 137 minute theatrical version of the film, not the 154 minute extended special edition. Rating: ***** The image quality of the Blu-ray for Total Recall (1990) is sharp at times, but there are also scenes that look dull, dark, or grainy. Looking at the film now, it may be hard to believe that Total Recall won an Oscar for special effects, as they don't seem that impressive today. Adapted from a story by Philip K. Dick, Paul Verhoven's futuristic adventure is still a very entertaining watch, but the spotty quality of the Blu-ray, and a lack of significant extra features, besides a generic featurette called Visions Of Mars, is a disappointment. Rating: ***1/2 For those who do not already own these films, this a sweet deal at around $11.50. Even if you already own previous versions, the Blu-ray editions are still probably worth having, particularly Terminator 2. Don't get rid of your older editions though, as they may contain bonus materials not included on the Blu-rays. TWO GREAT MOVIES ON BLU RAY FOR ONE LOW CHEAP PRICE = SHEAR AWESOMENESS!!! However, If you like special features than i recommend buying each movie separately. The combo deal is great. but I was used to the movie version so putting in deleted versions kinda ruined it for me. Arnie is in top form in these movies and a young Sharon Stone makes for great eye candy - recommended scifi action thriller - all in all this is a very good movie set - SBJ Terminator 2 is one of my all time favorites and you basically get Total Recall for free. What can I saw it is Arnold, and there could not ever have been greater to play the parts he played in all of his movies. I scored with 2 iconic films ever. Of course from my fav place to shop. R U kidding me. Two Shwartzennegger films for the price of one & they're both some of my favorites growing up & now I get to see them in bluray. 2 classic Arnold Schwarzenegger movies... A must have to complete any action movie collection If you already have one or both movies on DVD, you do not need to buy this 2-pack on Blu-Ray. Each movies is on its own Blu-ray disc and the back of the box claims it is in 1040p. Maybe it is in 1040p, but high rez of a grainy, dark transfer is not worth looking at. If you like the movies enough to want to own them, avoid this collection. I like Arnold Schwarzenegger, so I had to have this two-in-one. I don't like the remakes, so I buy the original movies. You have to watch Terminator 2. The movie is more than two hours. It was great! Total Recall is the same. There is more to the movie than you think. It was nice to see a movie without parts of it cut out. Arnold was me and my brother's favorite action star. I bought this for my son and he loves it. It's funny because who would think that we would both enjoy something from that many years ago? Looks better on the big screen TV then our small one but great quality either way. Good Arnold shwartheneger movies Good movies. Great I was really disappointed with the Blu ray transfer of Total Recall. It's just like the first DVD I owned with many areas of grain and uneven pic. T2 is simply ok but could have been much better. If Red Heat and Running man can have good transfers I fail to see why they didn't care about this set. Time to stop ripping off customers. Very sad. Love these two movies. Great deal. :) Great collection of Schwarzenegger movies thank you Product as stated. Very pleased"""	Terminator 2 Judgment Day

This 2 DVD set is awesome!!! Contains the extended widescreen version of the film!!! And the extras ara super cool too. The ultimate version of this classic film!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+ For those who have seen, Dances With Wolves, this extended edition, with 52 minutes on additional footage remastered and worked into the films, does the movie a service it's long deserved. Like the case refers to it, this """"beautiful story simply told"""" pulls you in to the lives of its characters in a way other movies that forego character development can't. The additional footage only adds to the story, and the special features do justice to one of my favorite movies ever. Well worth the money, this edition of Dances with Wolves will quickly remind you why you loved the film. I still love the DTS version which was release in 2 dics by IMAGE . This new version with 1 hour extended scenes split the movie in 2 discs was a major let down by it picture quality . The picture are too soft & lack any detail compare with the DTS version which was sharp with more detail resolution . The BIT RATE was much higher on the DTS version . Great movie with great first time DIRECTOR , KEVIN COSTNER . He deserve THE BEST DIRECTOR FOR DANCES WITH WOLVES . I think we also deserve the best DVD ENCODING for DANCES WITH WOLVES . BEST MOVIE , BEST DVD . i find it funny how many folks are upset that white men are portrayed as unflattering in this movie. the whole point of this movie is not only to entertain but to give us plain old white folks a taste of how those of other cultures felt when they had been portrayed as idiots,etc. Growing up and watching movies as a child on saturday mornings the only cool indian i remember was tonto. and what about tarzen kicking a whole bunch of natives behinds darn near single handedly? costner wants us to think and fill a little of what others have felt over the years.this i think was one of his main points of this great movie. also check out open range. OK, this movie isn't a religious experience or anything, though it came awfully close when I saw it back in '91. """"Dances With Wolves"""" was, at that time, the most amazing thing I'd ever seen. Ever. Its leisurely pace, the subtitles, the wide-open spaces, the landscapes ... the physical aspects alone of this movie were enough to turn my head completely around. To say nothing of the score, the photography, the writing, the characters, the acting, and Kevin Costner's lovely, skillful, controlled direction. To me, it was the be-all, end-all. I still love """"Dances."""" Revisionists are now saying that Costner's great film is too slow, too self-important, too benign, too whatever. I'm not real big on the idea that there's this huge jealousy factor at work against Kevin Costner, but in this respect, I'd have to say that people just seem to have something against the man, and they seem to begrudge him even """"Dances With Wolves."""" No matter. This is one of the best movies of the 1990s (or, I guess, late 1980s). It was obviously inspired by the great epics of the past (not the least """"Lawrence of Arabia"""") and paved the way for """"Unforgiven"""" and """"Braveheart."""" Costner stumbled with """"The Postman,"""" and has made more than his share of terrible movies, but he's got the goods as a director. """"Dances With Wolves"""" will more than stand the test of time. When you watch the run of the arrow of Samuel Fuller, you'll know why this a adaptation of that one, but without its force. I didn't have notice of Fuller's movie till I read a long interview in 1996 in a Spanish magazine called Nosferatu, in which Mr. Fuller complainted around the special fact that Dances was a light reading of the run of the arrow. But we know what happened with Samuel Fuller. I think Mr. Costner who undoubtly is very original with the use of the camera, seems to carry by the safe road of a tearful movie, in a clear searching of touching the soul and heart of the viewer. The excess of romanticism about an outlaw who decides to rebel against the rules. There're too many elemental situations close to clich, the story is too predictable than you'll be wondering why this movie won so many Academy awards if you compare with deepest and ambicious films , like The searchers, The naked spur, Ride the high country, Rio bravo, The man of the west, The life and times of judge Roy Bean, Sundance kid, Johnny guitar, The treasure of Sierra Madre, The wild bunch, The ballad of cable Hogue, Once upon a time in the west, or Tombstone (the best western in the last decade) to mention just a few. Don't forget that the western is the mithology of the american cinema. So having this statement in mind, it`s difficult conciliate the anti-hero figure and accept it like political correct. Thanks God that Mr. Costner thought a lot about that point and with his new film Open Range, he inscribed this film as the best western in this new century. I'm very glad about that. Because like Robert Refford and Clint Eastwood, Costner will be better remembered as director instead a standard actor And don't surprise if this new film is not so recognized like Dances, because it's too hard that another western be prized again by the Academy. It would be a record, considering that the Unforgiven won an Oscar by the best picture in 1992. The fact that four films like Dances with wolves, Unforgiven, Forrest Gump, American beauty,have been rewarding with the Oscar in just the last decade is a point that deserves an apart mention. But if you turn your attention in films like Patton, Braveheart and Gladiator, (winners too) you'll understand that there's something in the air. Kevin Costner may have made some movie duds, but he makes of for it in sensational movies. Dances with Wolves is one of my most favorite films of all time. It is so sad. It makes you feel bad for settling in America. The film has great perfomances throughout the entire film. The plot takes you into another world. The cinematography is also some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. The realism of the indian tribe and the way people lived in the 1800s is wonderful. Everyone should see this movie at some time in their lifetime, I highly reccomend it. Great movie and the quality of this VHS tape is very high. I'm proud to have this movie in my collection. I enjoyed the movie but felt that the picture and sound quality could be better to show off the majestic scenes. The packaging was simple enough. All the Oscars won by this marvelous Kevin Costner movie were deserved. It's the story of a soldier who, alone, manned a fort in the Dakotas and became a respected member of the Sioux tribe that lived nearby. You've got a romance, you've got an ecological lesson, you've got history, you've got the Noble Savage. You've got terrific character development, beautiful photography, an inspiring musical score, assured direction by Costner himself... It's simply a stunning achievement. Dances With Wolves is a good movie, a very good movie in fact. But . . . it's longer. Wasn't three hours long enough? Now it's four hours long. Seriously, I do not want to sit through a four hour movie when I could watch the same movie in three, especially when the extended version really doesn't help the movie in any way. It's just longer. The Reason for the cutting room floor is displayed in this, the bloated 236-minute Extended Cut on Blu-ray. One can see right away why these scenes were deleted in the first place, as they drag badly and do nothing to advance the story. There is no reason in the age of Seamless Branching, why these additional scenes could not be made selectable by the viewer, save for the obvious $$$$ grab by the studios setting up the inevitable double-dip on Blu-ray. I have loved this movie since having first seen it. This dvd of Dances With Wolves was in perfect condition and a joy to watch again. This movie is a delight for anybody not familiar with the real west. Costner overall attempt was to show that the plains Indians were not savages but very similar in their values to their Victorian whites. A BIG LIE. The plain Indians were barbaric and sadistic beyond any imagination. It was part of their culture. Before the settlement of the west by European immigrants, the Indians way of life was one of constant wars between the various tribes. The losers were raped, sold as prostitutes, scalped, skinned alive and burned on the stake. For hundred of years, they conudcted this way of life against Mexican settlements, and when the whites came from the east in the 19th century, they suffered the same fate. A big joke in this movie is portraying the Sue as giving women equal rights, or at least, maintaining a normal marriage. The warriors used to pick up women as they pleased, drop them, and pick up others. I know that some of you ignorant liberals will get heart attacked reading this. Good. Why don't you look at the truth for a change? Its easy now with the internet. The settlement of the west was accompanied by blood and gore of whites who were enslaved and tortured by the natives. The left wing loonies from Hollywood who gave this movie several awards should be ashamed of themselves. One of the best movies ever. This new blueray edition is the extended version which makes the movie even more epic, really completes the whole story and you have more depth of the movie. The bottom line is this movie is excellent because it entertains and the extended cut scenes now addedd to the 20th anniversary blueray is a huge bonus. A little long but none the less very best version available. FYI.........The packaging picture is a bit misleading. It's a sleeve, not a book type Blu-ray. Not a big deal, just pointing it out. I really love this service... it is amazing! I have been able to replace all of my old VCR tapes - I was amazed that they had all been converted.... I ordered the DVDs, and then a week later, they came! and in excellent shape. This is a superb version of the original. It should have been released this way. The picture and sound are quite excellent. Academy members love spectacle and sentiment. """"Dances With Wolves"""" delivered them masterfully; it's no wonder it won Best Picture. Though """"Dances With Wolves"""" moves at an occasionally measured pace, the relatively slow unfolding of the story and the characters' relationships works to draw the viewer in. The only bad thing is Kevin Costner's (mostly) miserable performance, which, amazingly, /doesn't/ pull down the film with it. But he simply can't act. His delivery is generally weak, flaccid, and unfocused -- and that's when he's working with other actors. When reading text (such as Dunbar's diary), he's even worse -- as clumsy as a teenager in a high-school play. If Costner were as poor a singer as he is an actor, he'd be lucky to be working in a sleazy lounge -- forget the Met. Watching this film for the third or fourth time, I wondered what the point was. Although the author of the novel (and screenplay) apparently wanted to tell an honest story about America's aboriginal"""	Dances with Wolves
6564	"Because of his extreme wealth and suave good looks  Edward Lewis could seemingly have any woman he wants  that committed significant other which he needs on his arm at social events to further how he makes his money as a corporate raider. However  he focuses more on his corporate raiding pursuits with his partner in crime  Philip Stuckey  his lawyer of ten years  than those women  with every significant other he's had in his life feeling neglected and eventually leaving him  this fact about which he is just coming to the realization. In Beverly Hills  Edward  in needing that woman on his arms as he and Philip work toward taking over the company owned by the increasingly insolvent James Morse  decides  based on a chance encounter  to hire Hollywood Boulevard hooker Vivian Ward as his escort for the week 24 7. He does so because he wants to have a professional who would be committed to the work  yet not have any commitments to her after the week is over. Beyond their chance encounter  he also makes this decision because she surprises him about how unhookerish she is in certain respects. Vivian  relatively new to Los Angeles and the business  still has to look and act the part  with Edward  beyond giving her money  leaving her largely to her own devices to do so. So she gets a somewhat unlikely Henry Higgins in Barney Thompson  the manager of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel where Edward is staying. Barney has to draw that fine line of keeping the hotel's upscale clients happy  while maintaining the posh decorum of the upper class  which does not include people coming into the hotel looking for rooms with hourly rates. As Barney and his associates are able to transform Vivian into a Cinderella  the questions become whether Vivian can go back to her Hollywood Boulevard life and whether she does have her Prince Charming beyond this week in the form of Edward or anyone else who truly does see her as Cinderella as opposed to a Hollywood Boulevard streetwalker.Comedy Romance , chick-flick destiny fairy-tale fairy-tales feel-good-movie feel-good girlie-movie good good-romantic-comedies happy-ending love love-story prostitution rags-to-riches relationships romance romantic romantic-comedy sappy sentimental shopping sweet women ,""I received exactly what I order, great price and what a savings. An oldie but a goodie LOVE IT Great movie LOVE THIS ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE Of course it was a great movie...with Julia Roberts and Richard Gere how can you go wrong!! Love that she shows anyone can be whomever they want and change their life situation. Great princess movie for those who dream. No problems. Good product. Great movie if you like to see someone rich falling for someone not so rich and both learning to better themselves. We have watched it at least once a year for the past 3 years. I believe it is about time we bought the DVD. excellent service and product A good movie n the DVD was a gift One of my all time favorite classic movies.....love it My favorite movie! great movie great movie for the time. There were a couple of surprising changes to the story line from the original videotape I had. A classic. A prostitute who's new to the trade picks up a wealthy guy (a businessman) just to help show him how to get to a Beverly Hills hotel and is asked inside- not for sex but for commeraderie. She has a bubbly personality and eventually he asks her to stay the week and to buy some conservative clothing to attend some business meetings with him. In this movie, cheap corner hookers are presented as naive, romantic, clean, """"pretty"""" girls who use colorful condoms and floss their white teeth and giggle in bubblebaths. They don't steal from you, they don't do drugs or get drunk, they don't curse, they don't have violent and dangerous friends, and they fit in at elegant parties so that no one can tell where they are from. They charm everyone who meets them, from the high-class hotel staff, to the high-class store workers, to the millionaires and the millionaire wives. We are supposed to believe that a millionaire businessman would marry a cheap hooker just as if she were a virginal princess in a G-rated fairytale. This cheap hooker actually thought that a millionaire could not afford to pay her $300. He left her alone in his hotel room during the day, with all of his things, and she never stole anything or had her """"clients"""" come in while he was gone. She never tried to """"work"""" the bar in the hotel lobby. She didn't try to come up with some schemes to get more money from him. When his attorney-buddy tried to """"do business"""" with her, she actually got insulted, and even more ridiculous, the millionaire actually defended her """"honor"""" to his buddy. The attorney-buddy was absolutely right by what he said, and he certainly did not deserve a broken nose for telling the truth. The hooker suddenly believes that she wants """"more"""" and turns down a deal that any hooker would love to retire into (a nice apartment with money and clothes, just to meet with this guy once in a while when he is in town) - - so, the """"pretty woman"""" does not want to be a """"kept woman,"""" but instead would rather get some minimum-wage job because she has no skills and no experience and no high school diploma. However, if she suddenly believes that she can get a real job, then why didn't she do that in the first place instead of becoming a hooker? We are supposed to believe that these two have fallen in love, in only one week of evenings together (remember, he leaves her alone while he works all day). What exactly do they love about each other? This millionaire was not grossed out by the fact that she is a cheap hooker, and he never asked her how long she has been a hooker and how many men she has been with. She tells him that she """"does everything"""" but he has sex with her like it is romantic lovemaking. The other hooker referred to her as """"Cinderella"""" which is ridiculous. I cannot imagine any prince who would pick up a hooker on a street corner and then propose to her a week later. There are escorts who are trained to do the job that this man wanted. If we are supposed to take this movie seriously, then this movie should have used an escort from a high-class agency. Do you want to see a comedy? I would love to see a sequel of this movie, where the wedding happens. The bride invites her only friends, who are hookers (she is estranged from her family), and the groom invites millionaires and clients (he also has no family). Maybe the hotel manager comes to give the bride away. The hookers and millionaires mingle at the reception until a huge fight breaks out. The attorney-buddy, who is the best man, has sex with all of the hookers in the men's room. The other hooker, who is the maid of honor, arranges meetings with all of the millionaires for while the happy couple are on their honeymoon - - they can meet at the couple's newly-purchased mansion while they are away. When they come home from their honeymoon, the bride realizes that she is pregnant, but the groom wonders whether the baby is his. One line from the song is the only thing about this movie that made sense : """"I don't believe you, you are not the truth."""" However, I am sure that whoever wrote the lyrics to the song did not have a hooker in mind. Regarding the acting, Richard Gere plays his usual wooden personality, and Julia Roberts does her usual overacting and over-bubbly character. They both have played those same roles over and over. This movie is a pathetic piece of garbage. Another moviie I've enjoy on this program. Great movie Ok This is a library collection for me. Enjoyable. Classic show it's just an excellent movie. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts at their best. This movie my childhood feels! Excellent. We had forgotten how much we enjoyed this movie the first time we saw it.

I like this movie because of richard gere's performance. I think julia roberts is cute but not beautiful. I find the actress who plays kit in the film way more attractive. Hector who plays the conciegere is way too stiff and not funny. Great gere though! Such a great movie! It's a classic but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. but its a decent movie and if you like Julia Roberts then you'll like this movie.

My only regret is a few scenes were changed, and I prefer the original. Still a great """"Feel Good"""" movie! right-- i havnt seen this movie in years -- since it aired on tv long ago ha --glad i got it -owens Its a great movie. I recommend Best """"chic click"""" ever. What else is there to say!! use it I really don't understand why the previous reviewer can already criticize the 15th Anniversary Edition of Pretty Woman. IT HASN'T EVEN COME OUT YET!! No one has seen it, including her, from what I read of her review. How can you possibly have the knowledge of what the 15th Anniversary Edition holds? I for one will wait until this addition actually comes out before I review it. I have only seen the original Pretty Woman, so anything extra will be a welcome treat for me, since it is one of my all-time favorite films. The reason I gave it Four STAR was that this Pretty WOMAN Version aint the Director's CUT Which I have ON LASERDISC!!!!!! The ONE I have on LASERDISC is 125 Minutes..So I heard it'd be released on DVD Soon,Probably on August,,Anyway 'tis a great LOVESTORY,,A MUST SEE :p I was terribly disappointed with the other version (10th) as it had scenes in the actual movie that weren't & made it a disappointment to me & friends.... DVDs can offer choices of adding deleted scenes...... a couple scenes ruined the whole movie for me. If this version can guarantee the theatre release version - I'm for it... I had not seen this movie in a long time so I decided to get it and watch it again. Even after all these years, I still enjoyed watching this movie. """"Pretty Woman"""" is about Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), a wealthy millionaire who is really bad with long term relationships. Enter Vivian (Julia Roberts), a prostitute that Edward accidentally meets to ask for directions. Edward feels something for her, and pays her to stay a week with him. However, during the week, they soon start falling for one another. But will they do anything to further their relationship? This movie made Julia Roberts rise to stardom, and gave her an Oscar nomination too (which she deserved). She acted her role as the street smart Vivian Woods very well. Richard Gere also acted nicely as Edward Lewis. Furthermore, the chemistry between Gere and Roberts is sweet and original in the movie (and they also pair up with Garry Marshall in """"Runaway Bride""""). The soundtrack for this movie adds well to the scenes. For example, Roxette's """"It Must Have Been Love"""" when Edward and Vivian are separating from one another, or """"Fallen"""" by Lauren Wood, when they are going to the Opera, adds nicely to the film. It gives a more 90s look to the film, which you don't see anymore these days. The DVD is not too bad either. It does have an audio commentary by Garry Marshall, along with the usual extras such as deleted scenes, theatrical trailers and production notes. Basically, a fairy tale movie with a little reality added to it. If you liked this movie, some other movies that I would recommend are """"While You Were Sleeping"""" and """"13 going on 30"""". The first thing that strikes the audience after have viewed Pretty Woman is the contrasting similarities between the two leads. One an aristocrat the other belongs to the lower class. They share occupational immorality in their quest for money. Neither fit into the other's environment, as each social setting requires a certain street smarts, or social etiquette, yet they manage with the help of the power of economic status. Despite their financial differences they both share a mutual vision of integrity and righteousness. Pretty Woman delivers a Cinderella story in the modern light where socioeconomic values are tested. Turning tricks is what the high school dropout Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) has to do when money is short and rent is due. It is not something she strives to do for a professional career, but her situation leaves her no other options than to seek monetary refuge in the oldest of professions. Carefully Vivian approaches her job with protection of latex and cleanliness, as dangers lure around every corner. In"""	Pretty Woman

Soon after his fianc  e Carla Pestalozzi announces that she is pregnant  Stanley gets a call from FBI director James Womack. Womack tells Stanley that San Francisco's Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage  along with 81 tourists  by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel who  for years  has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9  1995 drove General Hummel over the edge  and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across. Stanley is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Stanley knows how to disarm the bombs  but Stanley needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside. That man is former British intelligence agent John Patrick Mason  who has been in prison for the past 30 years without a trial because he was accused of stealing the private files of J. Edgar Hoover. In 1962  John became the only inmate ever to escape from Alcatraz  and he stayed out of Alcatraz long enough to father a daughter named Jade Angelou. Despite his extreme hatred of the FBI  John agrees to help Stanley.

There's some wry and tongue in cheek humour, especially from Sean Connery in his heyday as James Bond amidst all the wreckage from car chases and missile strikes, and a few of the characters are allowed to break through their stereotypical boundaries. Not surprisingly, the energy level is high, and there's plenty of action, ranking this film alongside Broken Arrow and Executive Decision among the year's best high-adrenaline offerings. Here, it's that a group of ex-Marines have stolen 15 VX gas rockets and are threatening to launch a lethal strike on the San Francisco Bay area if their demands aren't met. Led by war hero and living legend, Brigadier General Frank Hummel [Ed Harris], the crack platoon has holed up on Alcatraz, where they're holding 81 civilians hostage. The U.S. Government responds by sending a troop of Navy SEALs on a secret raid, using the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the island as their entranceway. Their guide is the only man ever to escape from the legendary Alcatraz prison: ex-SAS operative, John Mason [Sean Connery]. But also tagging along reluctantly in the party is FBI agent Stanley Goodspeed [Nicolas Cage], an admitted """"chemical superfreak"""" who has the knowledge and experience to defuse the 15 VX gas rockets. All of the cast are first rate and Nicolas Cage, doesn't really excel as an action hero, but he's a good enough performer to forge a likable character. Ed Harris portrays a surprisingly sympathetic bad guy. Unlike most villains in this sort of action packed film, Hummel isn't greedy or mad, just plain angry. He's championing a cause, in where he states, """"this isn't about terrorism, it's about justice,"""" and feels that drastic action is the only way to get people to listen to him. The other good actors are David Morse, who is Hummel's right-hand man. John Spencer portrays the FBI director, Michael Biehn is the SEAL team leader, and Vanessa Marcil is Goodspeed's pregnant fiance, who has been placed out of harm's way, for her own safety. But the real standout tour de force is, of course, is Sean Connery, Enter Connery as John Patrick Mason, a former British intelligence agent (shades of James Bond) who has been imprisoned for 30 years without a trial for stealing the private files of J. Edgar Hoover. John escaped from Alcatraz in 1962, for just long enough to father a daughter before his recapture. Like the general's beloved covert who is a total natural in the film and of course having lost none of his charisma with age, the veteran actor puts to use his mastery of mixing humour and action. Just like James Bond, Mason does all his shooting and battling with tongue in cheek. Along the way, he develops a nice rapport with Goodspeed, and of course you get chemistry with these two actors clicking together in the best """"buddy movie"""" fashion. The Rock' has a brilliant running time that really makes you savoir all of the characters in the film and any shorter time would have been a mistake and in doing so it gives you lots of scope to get under the skin of the character-building material of the actors and of course the script benefiting from getting to know the actors characters. The Rock represents the ultimate loud, fast-paced night's worth of entertainment of roller-coaster excitement. There are all the expected shoot-outs, explosions, and death-defying stunts. Director Michael Bay of Bad Boys doesn't break new ground, but he displays his command of the genre by keeping the familiar from becoming boring. The humour and the heart come in watching Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage go at each other and form a relationship while ducking bullets and bombs on Alcatraz. """"I drive a Volvo a beige one,"""" says Stanley, using his nerd status as an excuse for being a klutz commando. Stanley wants John to cut him some slack for doing his best. """"Losers always whine about their best,"""" says the impatient John, who wants to let it rip with full out, no excuses and makes mayhem, especially with Don Simpson films, it's surely no accident. The Rock' has two protagonists, one a dangerously skittering comet, the other a grounded realist trying to hold course are Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer in a nutshell. Producers Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have a highly-successful resume that includes Top Gun and Crimson Tide. The Rock will add more lustre and excitement to that reputation. Since Twister and Mission Impossible and have definitely lost all of their tremendous momentum, to be totally tedious and boring at the same time, and The Rock is poised to storm past them all. With Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, and a host of awesome action sequences, this is the kind of breath-stealing all year round entertainment that audiences crave for and you will not be disappointed. The Rock is a fitting wild-ride finale for the team of Simpson and Bruckheimer. It's a popcorn-movie deluxe. The Rock is exhausting in its own right and that's just one of several convincing reasons to see purchase this awesome Blu-ray disc. Blu-ray Video Quality This Blu-ray edition of 'The Rock' blows its standard inferior NTSC DVD counterparts out of the water 100%, especially The Criterion Collection DVD. With a stunning awesome 1080p encoded image, that will knock you for six. Equally stunning is the magnificent 2.35:1 aspect ratio that makes the screen come alive, and shows of the action pack film to its full potential. The Colours are very alive"""	Rock The

It has suspense, drama, comedy through out this marvelous Hitchcock Classic. I bought the Blu-Ray DVD and it is like watching this fantastic showing for the first time. Buy it now and enjoy North By Northwest! Amazing the first time you see it, the 2nd time you see it, and every time after that!!! I highly recommend this film. Especially the incredible scenes with Grant running away from a diving airplane. Beautifully filmed, scripted and timed, rarely if ever are movies made like that any more. A must see. Great movie and highly recommended. Preferably you should buy it on Blu ray but if not the DVD is not bad either. This is a story that holds your interest from start to finish. Cary Grant's character is mistaken for someone else by the villain, played by James Mason and the story unfolds with a pursuit of Grant by Mason across the country. Near the beginning. on a train, Cary meets Eva Marie Saint who is -- at this time -- a Mason accomplice. Her allegiance changes over the course of the picture, as you would guess. Particularly great are scenes on the Illinois prairie and at Mount Rushmore. I am only one in 1000's of folks who have expressed their appreciation for this prime example of Hitchcock's work. Bernard Herrmann's score and Cary Grant's charm/wit combine in an unparalleled entertainment experience. I've always loved Alfred Hitchcock movies, and this is one of his best. It was great watching it again with my wife and 15 year old son and daughter. They appreciated the great plot, directing, and the fact that a superb movie can be made without explicit adult themes, crude language, and special effects. I enjoyed watching this move. Its a very good old classic. No special effects just great acting and easy to follow story line. Check it out. It's classical Alfred Hitchcock...keeps you on edge the whole movie...they don't make 'em like this anymore...and you'll want to watch again and again... It's got Cary Grant...NEVER saw a movie he was in that I didn't love! He's a great classic actor, never (that I can think of) did he play in a movie that had """"questionable"""" content or could/should be referred to, as """"inappropriate."""" I wish there were actors like him today. He was a charming, funny, romantic and just a nice guy in every movie I've ever seen him in. I think I've seen just about a good thorough chunk of them. Cary Grant at his most debonair, Hitchcock at his best. Two of Hollywood's best combine to bring us pure magic. No matter how many times i have watched this film I still enjoy it. Now I own it and can watch it at my leisure. Released in 1959, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is and remains a brilliant piece of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock. Interestingly this boxed set (ASIN: B0000683U7) is a wonderful commemorative edition. This DVD of the film is a beautiful transfer. In addition to the DVD, there is a set of reproduction Lobby Cards in color, a reproduction 1-Sheet Poster, b&w stills and interestingly there is an actual celluloid frame from a copy of the film. The sound has been remastered in stereo and sounds incredible compared to the VHS copies that were only available before this. Bernard Herrmann's magnificent groundbreaking score truly stands out. This DVD print is brilliantly sharp and exceptionally colorful. To watch it again and enjoy like never before is to realize just how entertaining this film is and how it has stood the test of time. They really do not make them like this anymore. Cary Grant inimitably is Roger Thornhill. I like his personal book of cigarette matches monogrammed with R.O.T. The O stands for nothing so he tells Eva Marie Saint on the dinning car of the 20th Century Limited. You know, I have been drinking Gibsons ever since Cary Grant ordered one in that scene. Just one of the libations you pick up watching this endearing film. I enjoyed this old movie. A change of pace from reality tv. Love Cary grant movies,. Recommend for family as well. A classic. Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock combine for the expected classic production. Entertaining, fun, very well done. Highly recommended. North By Northwest 5 *some spoilers* I watched this on Turner Classic's television channel (TCM). All their movies aired yesterday (Sunday) was all Hitchcock. And then Robert Osborne would comment about each movie before and after it's shown on their show. Like the interesting fact that Hitchcock was working on films since the 1920's. I didn't know that. He's also helped changed suspense movies from all being a B-movie to a Must-See movie. That seems about right. I've seen only snip-its of this movie before watching it straight through. Like the famous scenes of the crop-duster airplane trying to kill Grant, as well as the very popular scene on the Mount Rushmore Monument. Seeing this entirely, I found it to be a really good spy suspense movie. The acting was really well done. And there was a lot of plot twists. So I felt - like Thornhill (Cary Grant), that there wasn't that many people to trust. There was of course some scenes where I wanted to throttle Grant - like taking a knife out of a dead guy's back at the U.N. building with loads of witnesses to see him do that. I would definitely call him a murderer before learning of his innocence because that's just plain stupid to take the knife. There was some new scenes that I really liked. The scene where Grant drives drunk down Long Island (which I learned was actually by the Californian coast and in Griffith Park - according to Wikipedia). The camera lense being obscured just so to make two things: 1) a night time illusion, and 2) a perspective look at what Thornhill saw while driving intoxicated. And the ending! This suspense building and then bam! Grant and Eva are on the train. That was nice to see their happy ending, but I think it could've been a better transfer between the two scenes. So after the movie was over on Turner Classic channel, Robert Osborne began telling some fun facts about the movie. The first fun fact was that Hitchcock was at first thinking of having Jimmy Stewart play Roger Thornhill. But then changed his mind and chose Cary Grant. Grant then tried to persuade Hitchcock to cast Sophia Loren as Eve Kendall. But Hitchcock chose Eva Marie Saint instead because he wanted a blond. It is a classic. I love Alfred Hitchcock mysteries. Cary grant is superb in this role. The plot has you at the edge of your seat. I fell in love with North By Northwest a long time ago and have always considered it one of not just Alfred Hitchcock's best films but one of the best movies ever made. I won't go into what it's about, I'm sure enough people will do that. But I am here to say this is a superb Blu-ray edition. My all time favorite Grant/Hitchcock film is actually To Catch A Thief but NBNW comes in a very close second and both films are excellently remastered on Blu-ray. I own the UK edition of the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection and for whatever reason it does not include North By Northwest of To Catch a Thief so to add to my personal Hitchcock Blu-ray film collection I had to purchase NBNW and TCAT as well as Strangers On A Train and Dial M For Murder which is slightly blurry due to the 3D tech at the time but is still a great film. Especially if you are a completest like me and want to round out your Grace Kelly and Cary Grant Hitchcock films in your collection. Kelly did three films for Hitch: Dial M For Murder, Rear Window and To Catch A Thief while personally my three favorite Cary Grant films are North By Northwest, To Catch A Thief and Charade. All available as exquisite remastered editions on Blu-ray. Charade available as a Criterion Collection edition. I originally owned a Criterion Laserdisc of NBNW but this Warner Digibook Edition blows that out of the water, it's a shame that Criterion lost the rights to so many titles like 2001, North By Northwest, The Fisher King and Time Bandits but they have found renewed life on Blu-ray. I only really mourn for The Fisher King because only the Criterion Collection Laserdisc had commentary and deleted scenes and so many special features that do not accompany any other video version of the film. But North By Northwest either as a stand alone digibook by WB or in the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection is in itself a masterpiece of a movie. This is a great Hitchcock film and probably my favorite Cary Grant flick. Grant is mistaken for a secret agent that doesn't exist. The bad guys apprehend Grant and he gets away ... etc. A real cat & mouse type action through out the movie. Classic movies such as I am, you will enjoy this movie. One would never know it is almost 2hrs long. It just kept my interest which can be a difficult thing to do as is. I honestly wish the charm of these classics would return to our movie theaters. One of the best films by Hitchcock, and one of the most popular films ever, North By Northwest is also one of those rare films that is even loved by people who are normally sticklers for detail. No matter that most of the incidents, most of the situations, and of course Hitchcock's beloved """"MacGuffin"""" plot device do not make sense. Every element, however unbelievable, is so well done and so entertaining that we forgive the nonsense. Cary Grant is New York advertizing executive Roger O. Thornhill, or ROT as it says on his personalized matchbooks. He is mistaken for a government agent by foreign spies and kidnapped with the intent of murder. He narrowly escapes, and in an attempt to find out why he was targeted he goes to the U. N. building to question the owner of the house where he was held captive, only to have the man murdered before his eyes by a thrown knife, a knife that naturally ends up in Thornhill's hand. Now on the run, he heads north by northwest for Chicago, then Rapid City South Dakota, following clues to clear his name. Eventually Thornhill and Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a member of the spy ring, end up running for their lives atop Mt. Rushmore, leading to the famous scene where they are chased across the face of George Washington while Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt and Lincoln look on. This is a marvelous film, mixing murder and humor as only Hitchcock could do it. The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is a classic, and fits Hitchcock's implausibly clockwork plot like a glove. A tiny aside: watch the little boy at the table in the background of the Mt. Rushmore cafeteria scene, as pistol-packing Eve Kendall confronts Roger Thornhill. Obviously they had rehearsed this scene a few times, and this kid was prepared. And you should be prepared too, prepared to enjoy a fine evening of entertainment with the Master of Suspense and his talented crew: Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint, James Mason as Vandamm the spy master, Leo G. Carroll as """"the Professor"""" at the CIA, and Martin Landau as a spy henchman. Pure entertainment, and now available in high definition on Blu-ray. And all those things you don't know about the top of Mount Rushmore, like the road, the luxury home and the airstrip? The film will reveal them all to you. Who could ask for more? This is another great thriller with a wonderfully great cast. NOTHING compares to actors/actresses who know their craft. AND"""	North by Northwest

A fine addition to our collection. Casablanca, 1942 film The story is set in Casablanca after the fall of France. Refugees crowd the city, waiting to flee abroad. Rick, an American expatriate, runs a caf (with gambling in a backroom). This operation is protected by the local Chief of Police. The first funny scene is where Victor Laszlo, wanted by the Gestapo, appears under his own name! Then he is introduced to the Nazi chief! All so polite (can you believe it?) Rick is said to be on the blacklist, with a price on his head. How did he not just escape, but wind up with a caf? I suggest Rick made a deal with the authorities, and works as a high-grade informer. Its not an accident that Yugartes is arrested after he shows up at Rick's and confesses. Rick has knocked around way too much to be so sentimental in Paris. The question is whether the Laszlos will be able to escape to Lisbon, and then to America, with the transit papers. Those German soldiers sing Wacht am Rhein, a 19th century nationalist song. Watch on the Rhine was a stage play and a later film. Conrad Veidt portrays the top Nazi with ominous overtones and underplayed evil. Rick shows sentimentality with the Bulgarian couple; was this just a whim or some sort of pay-off to explain a large sum of money? Victor Laszlo escapes from an underground meeting. Wouldn't he be under constant surveillance? There is a surprise ending. Rick double-crosses Louis to let Victor and Ilse leave. The foggy night creates atmosphere (is fog possible in the desert?). Major Strosser arrives, but somehow lacks his usual retinue and pays dearly for his mistake. [Believable? It echoes the fate of Heydrich.] The real scandal is not that Rick and Louis run off together to join the Free French. It is that nobody escaped from the concentration camps of the Gestapo unless they were turned into double agents. This suggests Victor is now a Nazi agent (read some of the post WW 2 books)! The efficient British counter-intelligence would soon deal with him. Or could Rick really be a triple agent, who uses Louis' affection to escape to Allied territory after effecting the escape of Victor and Ilse? The charm of this film seems to be its classic restraint and understatement with its stilted language. It has unity of time, place, and action. The film is fast-paced and tightly edited. The Hollywood Production Code supported the happy ending where Victor and Ilses marriage continued after their hardships. The cleverness of this film is how it layers sentimentality over a rude reality, like some old-fashioned fairy tale that has different meanings for children and for adults I think the happiness of the performers shows in their stage presence. Many were refugees from Nazi Europe. This makes it a better film than Citizen Kane and its cynical performers. One flaw is the story of exit visas which cannot be canceled; no government would do that. Force majeure trumps a piece of paper. The book Round Up the Usual Suspects tells about the making of this film, whose story transcended the usual money-making entertainment. The popularity of this film was followed by a series on radio, as with other films (Sam Spade). That is where Play it again, Sam may have originated. There was also a popular novelty tune inspired by this film.. Classic.

One of a young couple trying to get to America and the girl wondering if a girl should have to do something naughty was wondering what would happen if her husband, """"a boy in many ways"""", would find out? A second rate crook (Peter Lorre) obtains something of value at the expense of two German curriers. A Police Captain (Claude Rains) is shocked to find there is gambling going on at Rick's as he stuffs his pocket with his gambling earnings. Many other stories surround the main theme of a love triangle that started in Paris and now can mean so much to individuals or the effort for freedom. Will the Nazi's win their prize? Will Capt. Renault get the young girl? Will Rick get away with Ilsa? This film has become quite a classic. There are many quotes and misquotes attributed to the film. You will find your self kibitzing. One memorable seen for all is the showdown where the Germans are singing """"Watch on the Rhine"""" and Yvonne (Madeleine LeBeau) over powers them and herself with tears in her eyes singing the """"La Marseillaise.""""

RESTORED TO BEYOND IT'S ORIGINAL LUSTER. SPECTACULAR RESTORED PICTURE AND SOUND. I must say the 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition of """"My Fair Lady"""" is worth every penny if you are a musical lover. The extensive work that has gone into this restored edition deserves to be hailed as one of the very best Blu-Ray releases of all time. Mr. Harris and his team should be proud of preserving and restoring a musical classic for many generations to enjoy. I have a 78 inch 4K Ultra hd TV that adds to the spectacular reproduction of the picture quality. If you love this big movie musical buy it again you won't be disappointed. Just a classic! Finally, the treatment this classic deserves. I won't go into the movie itself which I love and deserves the five star rating, rather my comment is regarding the Blu-ray disc I got. The video restoration is indeed magnificent, especially after the horrible previous Blu-ray release. However, my surround speakers are not getting any audio from the Blu-ray's Dolby TrueHD 7.1 Master Audio; only the the front speakers. On the other hand, the accompanying DVD's 5.1 Dolby track is fine, with all speakers getting ther corresponding audio. Is there anyone else out there with this same audio problem in the Blu-ray disc? Amazon has generously offered to replace the whole package, without even requiring me to return the defective disc (great service!). I'm hoping the replacement disc won't have this issue, but I'm wondering if this is a one-disc problem or a lot or batch issue. Any comments will be appreciated. Pygmalion was meant to satirize the rigid British class system of that period while also adding commentary on women and their fight for independence. Add music and an almost happy ending and you have My Fair Lady. Not exactly what Shaw had intended but close enough. The music is fantastic (although Julie Andrews would have sung the part better than Marni Nixon did). Rex Harrison and Wilfrid Hyde-White are hilarious as the conniving pair anxious to win a bet that they can turn a drudge into a princess. The costumes are impossible yet incredible (an Oscar for Cecil Beaton). An almost perfect musical (Audrey Hepburn notwithstanding). This newly restored bluray version is great. It pretty much corrects the horribel first bluray release. Recommended! Plays great in European bluray play ers. This DVD had great picture and sound quality. My Fair Lady the ORIGINAL starring Audrey Hepburn has be digitally enhanced for the little screen and folks like my 81 year old mom love it. This movie needs no introduction or praise. I recommend to anyone and any age. Male, female, in any country. If you enjoy classics, this must be at the top of your list. this is one of my all time favorite movies from Audrey ... these characters are great!! I had it in VHS form and wanted a DVD. I love Audrey Hepburn and her movies. She is so adorable and sophisticated. This move is funny yet very poignant. Good movie!! This is a great classic to have among the collections in our home. We love it as we see a young woman transformed into a lady and a man transformed into a """"gentleman."""" This is one of the best movies ever made. I could be feeling down and just putting it on brings a smile to my face (if not outright laughter. If you are familiar with the story of """"Pygmalion"""" where a man fell in love with his creation. It's a version of it. The younger generation might know """"Mannequin"""", no other version can compare and Audrey Hepburn is perfect in the role of Eliza Doolittle. Rex Harrison as Prof. Higgins. I had previously bought the DVD, but had to buy the Blu-ray combo Another one of my favorites. The Neo-packaging is gorgeous, this is essentially wrapped in magnets, keeping the case closed and lined with artwork all the way through. Getting the discs out can be a little tough though, I would've preferred a """"button"""" layout. The film itself has been meticulously restored from original film elements, and it neither looks or sounds as though it's over 50 years old! Just astounding. It has a great mixture of insightful bonus features, and the Blu-ray discs are Region free, so they can be played anywhere in the world. The DVD however, is Region A-locked (American/Region free players only). It has several subtitle options, which is great as well. Overall I doubt you could fair much better with My Fair Lady, if only the """"pockets"""" for the discs weren't so cumbersome, I may have given this a perfect grade, because it's nearly flawless. Love this movie. I am a happy customer. Excellent movie, of course, but crummy packaging. Theres no actual plastic snap holder for the discs, merely a shallow, poorly constructed indention in the cardboard to hold the discs; all of which were loose when I opened the shrink wrapped package. Great movie A good buy Well done! One of my favorite movies, for rainy Sunday afternoons. I know every song. Good Great service - delivered as planned. Audrey Hepburn is great, enjoyed this movie. WIFE LIKED I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! My kids think it's funny the way Eliza talks so they even watch it with me. I miss movies like this. Before everything was sexualized. A classic movie based on a classic play with classic actors and actresses - it doesn't get better. An upgrade from DVD for me. The BR version is truly beautiful with clarity and saturated color, even in shadow areas. There is one long feature which includes segments on the film restoration and casting and vocal decisions. Two songs are included with Hepburn's original singing. But the other features are not essential covering premieres of the film with celebrity participation. The musical itself is a classic of course, with a clever story and songs. Very little dancing which is really a necessity for me in a musical. Audrey Hepburn is enchanting with a lively personality and quite an emotional range. This is s stage bound production but I found the sets to be charming and did not detract from the file at all. The movie is great but the DVD has 2 skips in it. I would return it but I lost the cover. Audrey Hepburn made so many greats that are now Classics. Another favorite Ty Amazon great movie great quality. A wonderful restoration of My Fair Lady. I love the play; I love the movie. This restoration makes the movie much more attractive and inviting than the previous Blu-Ray edition. It draws the viewer into the presentation. The faces, and everything else in the picture, are clear and inviting. The colors are great. The sound, both dialog and music is of much higher quality - its now hard to believe that the movie was released over 50-years ago. It seems fresh and new. At the very beginning of the movie, when the music starts and the flowers are on the screen, it is now clear that one is about to watch something special. Fantastic, love this film, best actors and music, don't miss it excellent The details were superb. The opening scene illustrated the sharpness of the images. .

Many of the top-ranked """"My Fair Lady"""" reviews on Amazon refer to a defective and out-of-date 2011 Blu-Ray release. The 2015 50th Anniversary re-restoration fixes the issues from the earlier, inferior restoration. The visual quality is simply stunning. I don't have a home-theater system, so I can't offer expert opinion about the audio, however, I did experience an initial fluttering or card-shuffling sound with the English 7.1 Dolby TrueHD track. The noise disappeared when I switched to one of the alternate audio tracks (six languages) and then switched back to English. The packaging is appropriately chic and feels sturdy initially, but the container is made mostly out of card stock, and I suspect it will suffer above-average wear and tear over time. Unlike earlier releases, I think this edition of """"My Fair Lady"""" truly measures up to Blu-Ray standards. just what I needed Love it Stunning picture quality on the restored Blu-ray. Highly recommended! What a classic!! My child needed this for a school project but I know we'll watch it again & again. A CLASSIC AND MUST SEE wonderful show. Highly recommend Fantastic movie, wonderful music, Audrey Hepburn superb, Rex Harrison magnificent and July Andrew's young voice but still adorable.

Five stars no hesitation. What can you say, probably as good as it will ever get for this classic from the 30's. Of course there no comparison to this great move, Vivien Leigh IS Scarlett and never looked hotter. Those eyes burning with passion. If Clark Gable didn't have that he was nuts.! Either way you say it, a timeless Masterpiece, and thanks to the well deserved restoration we can get as close to seeing it in the best condition since it opened originally in 1936. Some say this is a racist movie. Frankly it does reflect the southern culture that still existed in the South in the 1930's Get over it@!!! This was made then, not now. You have to look at this story from the storyline perspective, not just some rose-tinted view. This collectors edition I got on a discount and its worth the 40 I paid. Blu-ray is the way to go though, stupendous features and the little tv Movie they did in the 70's about the making of with Tony Curtis was very good. I'd forgotten they used to make stuff like that. Of course the documentary about the making of was very good. Excellent presentation. 5 stars for what a restoration box set should be. My first viewing of this film in 1961 left me impressed; I had just finished reading the book and marveled at how closely the fillm followed the book. Leaving out Scarlet's other children was just fine with me. My reason for only four stars is the casting of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes. In the book, Ashley is a tall, young, strong, and very handsome southern gentleman. As good as an actor that Howard was, he does not even come close to fitting the description; the documentary showing how much makeup it took just to get him to look younger is revealing. For me, he looks and acts just like the wimp he played in Of Human Bondage! It is said that he took the role because he was promised a directorial job in the future which may or may not have occurred if he had not died in the plane that was shot down in 1943 by German aircraft. C'est tout. I have perused the various reviews concerning the aspect ratio. I am old enough to be thoroughly acquainted with the subject, but I have a question. My standard DVD (the latest before the hi def) looks quite good on a 71' widescreen TV, but the light gray sidebars are extremely disracting. Does the new issue have the sidebars, and, if so, are they black so as not to distract? EVERYTIME A CLOTH BOXSET OF GONE WITH THE WIND COME OUT, I GET HEADACHE ABOUT ITS ATTRATION TO DIRT AND DUST. ARE YOU TRYING TO SHOW ME TIME IS CRUEL LIKE """"DUST IN THE WIND""""? From the first moment when you unwrap the plastic surrounding this box set, you know you are in for a treat. The (red) velvet feel of the box in your fingers is unlike any I have experienced with any DVD or Blu-ray set before now...and why not, this movie has been considered the greatest film ever made. Does it deserve any less than the best packaging there has ever been? With its """"70th Anniversary Gone With the Wind"""" in gold letters on all four sides set against the red velvet...aw, sheer ecstacy. But then, a moment of panic...what if the interior doesn't match up to such a buildup (much the same worry the audience probably had in 1939 prior to geting to see GWTW after such a massive buildup)? But there is absolutely nothing to fear. When you open it up, you are greeted with a picture of Scarlet O'Hara on the inner lid. If upon opening the lid, had I heard the Tara theme suddenly playing (you don't), I would not have been surprised. This truly looks and feels like a beautiful treasure box. Inside, you find a 52-page hardcover photo and production art book. While not filled with the detailed behind-the-scenes writing of the similar Wizard of Oz book, the photos and artwork will please any GWTW fan. Next is the reproduction of the original 40-page souvenir program (there were two versions issued, one with Hattie McDaniel pictured on the backcover with the other stars and one for the South without her. This is the one with her). Unlike the repro issued with the 2005 DVD set, this program is almost the same size as the original program (this one measures approx. 7.5 x 10 inches). After this you get several pages of David O. Selznick memos and other correspondence. Nice touch. What's that, you want more? Okay, how about 10 5x7 color cards showing production drawings in a nice folder called """"The Art of Gone With the Wind""""? How about a CD with approximately 35 minutes of music from the soundtrack? There is a four page booklet that serves a directory of what are on the three discs in the set. Then some promotional flyers for TCM DVDs and other items. (I thought there was going to be a promotional offer for the GWTW poster but either it is missing from my set or they changed their mind about that as there is no mention anywhere on the outer listing of items about any such offer.) Now, all that wasn't enough, we now get to the heart of the box, the very lovely (and STURDY) foldout containing the Blu-ray disc containing the movie, the Blu disc with the extras, and the double-sided DVD that has the fabulous 6-hour documentary, """"MGM: When the Lion Roars."""" The high definition print is beautiful. The work done on this really shows. The scenes may not jump out at you screaming how much it has been restored, but when you look at the sharpness, the clean clarity of the picture, you know that unless you have seen it in the theatre you have never seen it looking so good. One weakness is in the audio. Though it has a Dolby True HD track, I found myself having to crank up the volume to be heard normally. The movie comes with the commentary by Rudy Behlmer from the previous DVD release. The movie is alone on the first disc. The goodies are all on the second one... The bulk of them have been ported over from the DVD prior edition, but now we also get to enjoy the wonderful documentary, """"1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year"""" and the made-for-TV drama of """"Moviola: The Scarlett O'Hara War."""" I hadn't seen the latter since the Moviola mini-series first aired those decades ago, and I groaned inwardly as I watched the opening credits and saw who was cast in some of the most important roles (Tony Curtis as Selznick, Sharon Gless as Carole Lombard, to name two), but upon starting to view it, I found myself enjoying it for what it was. (And, happily, the video quality is far superior to that of The Dreamer of Oz, the John Ritter TV-movie in the Oz set.) Be happy, this box set is all you could hope it would be. This is the most beautiful version of Gone With the Wind you could ever own. The box is sturdy and velvety. Inside are various items from the movies production. The blu-ray version of the movie will take your breath away! Stunning crisp picture and sound and all together extremely well done! Always like the flix and especially Gable. Forget this hyped up info package unless you're into that sort of thing. I should have just gotten the film version. The product arrived in perfect condition. Great up convert. Movie truly does look better that I have ever seen it. <div id=""""video-block-R18T9OUGGSG2P8"""" class=""""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""""></div><input type=""""hidden"""" name="""""""" value=""""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B15TRrKz8bS.mp4"""" class=""""video-url""""><input type=""""hidden"""" name="""""""" value=""""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/118FVB7Lr-S.png"""" class=""""video-slate-img-url"""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a review of the """"Gone with the Wind"""" 70th Anniversary Blu-Ray Limited Edition Set. - 2 Blu-Ray Discs (Movie + Special Features) - Bonus DVD - 'MGM: When the Lion Roars' - Collectible Art Book w/ 50+ pages - cast, sets, design, wardrobe, etc. - 10 Watercolor Art Prints (5x7"""") - 1939 Program reprint - Soundtrack CD Please see video for pictures of the set. Great collection for the GwtW enthusiast in your life. Made for a great gift. This is our third copy of Gone With the WInd - a VHS and DVD preceded this blue ray. Yes, the color is stunning, pictures crisp and clear. My wife is the big fan of this movie and watched over half of it by herself. Unable to finish it in one sitting, I had to put it back in the dvd player the following night. I asked her where she stopped and waited for the opening menu. It appeared in due course but there was no way to select a specific scene. I had to fast forward for over half of the movie. Really, for nearly $50 I expect scene selection. This is why I only gave it three stars. EVERYTIME A CLOTH BOXSET OF GONE WITH THE WIND COME OUT, I GET HEADACHE ABOUT ITS ATTRATION TO DIRT AND DUST. ARE YOU TRYING TO SHOW ME TIME IS CRUEL LIKE """"DUST IN THE WIND""""? Nice set. Comes with lots of extra printed materials worthy of the huge box and high price. The video on the Blu-ray itself is a nice improvement over the DVD. Not so much in terms of clarity, as the DVD did fine. But mostly in color fidelity. For all Warner's work before, there remained a noticeable flicker of color. Each frame looked good, because they worked frame by frame. But the color would darken and lighten and change slightly over the course of several frames, then back again. Simply look at the opening scene with Scarlet's white dress out on the porch on the DVD. Watch as the bright white changes to pink, then green, then back to white. Very subtle, but it happens. That effect has always disturbed me while watching a film. I have noticed it on other Warner Brothers movies like Ben-Hur. This is why I prefer the type of computerized restoration done by Lowry Digital (recently changed to DTS Images or something) rather than the frame by frame work Warners does. They do an outstanding job, but don't take into account the changes from frame to frame. Anyway, that effect is minimal here on the Blu-ray, and to see it at all, you have to watch very closely for it. Thanks Warner Brothers! Now I can watch the film itself rather than just seeing rainbows and storm clouds. The sound is about as clear as it could ever be for a 70 year old film. Good work. I gave a 4 star rating rather than 5, because my box was broken on arrival. One corner was torn. So I feel compelled to point that out. Also, I like the movie, but I don't love it. It appeals to my wife more than to me. So 4 stars. I bought the blu ray version of this movie and the transfer is just jaw dropping! This set comes with the blu-ray movie on one disk, hardcover book with pictures of the cast/sets/publicity photos, memos from david o'selznick,postcard photos of the sets, publicity booklet, and a cd sampler. Overall excellent presentation and I'm very pleased with the set. The picture is just beautiful and the details are amazing. When I first bought this movie I had my doubts if it would really look any better than the dvd version that I bought a few years back. Boy was I blown away ! The clarity in this movie is just excellent and the picture was sharper and clearer than the dvd release. There is a clarity and sharpness in this movie that"""	Gone with the Wind

Whenever I need a good laugh, these are sure to provide it. none Great Always a great set of movies starring the one and only Don Knotts This is a set of really funny Westerns... the grand kids laughed all the way through.. Loved it I love his work. So funny and yet so family friendly! Just enjoy Don Knotts movies. Very funny lots of fun with grandkids Gift 4 different movies with don knotts and few other funny comdians, they al 4 get good belly laughs in a western movie style Love Don Knotts! Don Knotts was one of America finest comedy actors of his time! This is a collection of 4 Disney movies Don Knotts star in - each one was a instant classic! The 4 movies on this dvd collection is the following: 1. The Apple Dumpling Gang, 2. The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again, 3. Hot Lead & Cold Feet, and 4. Gus! great Good movie Great family movies. A decent set of movies featuring Don Knotts, comic actor legend. The movies vary in humor and quality, and are the usual fare for 1970's Disney. It's a bargain. I actually saw all the films offered in this set at the theatre, and they bring back some good memories. Some of the films are better than others, and perhaps are not up to the production standards of today's more aesthetically appealing family films from Disney and other studios. The Apple Dumpling Gang is a good family film, the Return of the Apple Dumpling Gang is a bit adult for a Disney film. Hot Lead and Cold Feet has some good moments in it, and GUS the field kicking donkey brings back some good memories of seeing the film in the theatre. Like I say, they're older films, so they're going to have some shortcomings. They're not exactly low budget, but they're not exactly the high gloss product that Disney cranks out today, though still visually respectable. But hey, for the price of one film you get four. If you're a Disney fan or grew up during the 70s and remember these films, then maybe splurge on a set. Enjoy. Got for my wife, she enjoyed it I love these movies and glad I could get them again on DVD It has all the elements of a very funny movie. It is great for the entire family. Doesnt matter what age you are, you have to love the Apple dumpling gang!! Fun and clean. Worth the money. I love this movie set! Got these for my mom & she is thrilled with this video. I was happy to get 4 movies in one! Both of these movies are extremely entertaining and suitable for the entire family. The Apple Dumpling Gang is better than its sequel due to the interactions of all of the major stars. Susan Clark is excellent as Dusty, and Bill Bixby is wonderful and believable as Donovan. The children do an excellent job and appear to have good on screen presence. I would recommend it for children of all ages, including adults who are young at heart. The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again is good, but it relies more on slapstick than the first movie. You miss the parts of Dusty and Donovan and the children. It is also a little confusing that Harry Morgan plays in both productions, but plays two separate characters. They could have said that he was the Justice of the Peace's twin brother or a look alike relative. Of course he always does an excellent performance in whatever part he plays. My grandson laughed and laughed at these funny, silly movies. They are truly timeless. very entertaining LOVE these classic movies. Apple Dumpling Gang was the first movie I ever saw at the Cinema. Absolutely HILARIOUS scene at the fire station! =) It was fun to watch these movies, they keep you laughing. Funny and fun to watch. good movie Got to love Don Knotts Really funny.

Both movies are laughing out loud funny especially the first one. Knotts and Conway were great together. A good movie to watch when you're down. A great addition to a comedy movie collection. Worth any price. I love the Apple Dumpling Gang! Especially when Don Knotts is one of them. He always gives me a chance to laugh. The Apple dumpling gang here to make you laugh Great movie and funny the first movie is really good. the second movie is """"okay"""" good family movie a gift to the grandkids thank you again Purchased as a gift. great.

Picture is good with no added digitzations or re-colorings. These movies are ust fun and entertaining for the whole family. Kids and adults will love it. I enjoyed these movies when I was young and I enjoyed them with my kids. Now that I am older, I find them just as fun and comforting. When you're looking for a great comedy, & you find one with both Tim Conway & Don Knotts --- you can't go wrong!! These two movies are full of laughs & great for the whole family. These are by far our most favorite movies of all time! It definitely met all of our expectations & more. And we were thrilled to get both movies in one package! My son-in-law just loves it These are two hilarious class Disney comedies! These are full of great fun, slapstick humor, and Don Knotts/ Tim Conway flubups! All ages will enjoy these funny shows! Definitely worth your time! GREAT! What can you say, Don Knotts was a talented actor. This brings back memories my childhood...Cheesy but fun. great Awesome Dumb! The're noneducational, those two men doesn't know what they're doing to them selves, end up other place in accident. Nothing they're just plain dumb! Funny and adventurous, this DVD is entertaining for the whole family. It's one I'll enjoy for years. Love movies like this. The combination of Don Knotts and Tim Conway is always a winner. The two make several attempts to rob the bank or a wealthy man who has come to town but all fails. With their slapstick comedy, this movie is a winner for anyone who enjoys this combination. All the older Disney movies are great. Even the grandsons like them. They can't believe these are old Disney movie's. Great Family time!! Very happy, never seen these in australia (according to me) Suitable for all the family, easy watching, traditional western with some humour I received the movie in a very timely manner. It was well packaged and arrived ahead of schedule. I am one of the older generation, so love the nice clean family entertainment. When this movie is in my DVD player, I do not have to worry about my younger grandchildren seeing something they shouldn't see. There are still those of us who think many of the movies today are totally unsuitable for young viewers. Don Knotts and Tim Conway were so funny together. I know I shall enjoy this a long time. I am so thankful that this type of viewing is available to us. Thank you! This is not the era of all the best of Disney, but watching Don Knotts and Tim Conway will still have you in stitches. My kids also love these movies and my 9 year old son especially enjoys the break from the animation... I appreciate being able to show my kids a movie without crude humor with the wholesomeness that still existed when I was a kid, which actually wasn't so long ago afterall. I grew up watching this and just had a lot of good memories. It's still a great show and Knotts and Bixby are hillarious! This was fine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . ..... . . . . ... these two actors know how to act! they make it look natural at the things they try to get away with on these two movies, This 2 pack of the Apple Dumpling Gang will make you laugh and you will be HAPPY to have this movie set in your home movie selection. So love watching Don Knotts and Tim Conway! nice to find both movies together although I do prefer the first It's California gold country, and an elegantly attired man rides his horse along a river track with a mournful harmonica in the background. At nightfall, he rides into Quake City, secretly observed by two men up to no good. They pull up their bandanas and attempt to rob the rider - with spectacular lack of success. We've just met Theodore Ogelvie and Amos Tucker (played with hilarity by Don Knotts and Tim Conway) - and two more hapless crooks would be hard to find. The elegant fellow is Russel Donavan, smooth-talking itinerant gambler (played with heart by Bill Bixby). The next day, for a small payment, he agrees to help out John Wintle, by signing for the valuables Wintle has coming in on the stagecoach. What a surprise for ardent-bachelor Donavan, when the valuables turn out to be Wintle's orphaned kin - three kids! Sheriff/Judge Homer McCoy (Harry Morgan) sets Donavan straight: """"You don't jump another man's claim. You don't steal his wife, woman or whiskey. You don't strike a bargain and then entertain second thoughts about the matter. Any one of these offenses can make you the exalted guest of a hemp party!!"""" And the hilarity continues. The kids own half of the Commodore Mine, but it's played out. Or is it? The notorious Frank Stillwell Gang is after the 356 pound nugget in the bank vault. But so are Amos and Theodore, who really don't want to meet Stillwell again, having accidentally shot him in the leg when they worked for him before. That's the first movie. The sequel is even funnier, this is laugh out loud stuff. Amos and Theodore are trying to go straight. They saunter into Junction City, on the Wild West plains, and proceed, with the help of their mule, Clarice, to wreck destruction where ever they go. They accidentally join the army at Fort Concho and the army doesn't know what hit it. Hard on their trail is Marshal Woolly Bill Hitchcock, absolutely blazingly hilarious (played by Kenneth Mars) as the boys accidentally shoot both his hands, leave him in a neck brace, nearly burn him alive, and rob him of his sanity. The Bonus Extras are on the 1st disc, with the 1st movie: 1. Audio Commentary for 1st movie, recorded in 2003. Commentators are Tim Conway, Don Knotts, Susan Clark (plays stagecoach driver Dusty) and Brad Savage (plays Clovis, the 8 year-old middle child). Susan says that she came in on her day off to watch Knotts and Conway film the firehouse scene, where Amos and Theodore steal a ladder from the firehouse for their bank robbery. Conway says, """"This was a scene that was totally unrehearsed by Don and I.... We just kind of winged it.""""

This is one of the best renditions of Robin Hood. fine My favorite Robin Hood version. Watch it at least twice a year. Very good Good movie Great Nice quality. This is my favorite version of this story starring a very young Kevin Costner. Alan Rickman is awesome as the villain. TY Great Great dvd This is very interesting. Was not what I thought I was buying, but I am very satisfied that I down loaded it to my kindle. Good film Great movie with extra scenes and on blu ray. One of the better Robin Hood movies. Comedy and action. This is always a great movie for all times. Very good. good A very good version of Robin Hood. The extended cut added a bunch more stuff about the witch. I preferred the original. I collect Robin Hood's. Kostner didn't fly but I loved the entire support cast. awesome thanks Christian Slater's """"F"""" bomb, totally inappropriate, a couple suggestive comments about sex, unnecessary. Overall, besides these things, one of my MOST favorite movies of all time! Love this movie! Good Classics I love this movie great adventure show. I like all the Robin Hood movies, but this is one of my all time favorite As always with Kevin Costner...he is more interested in making political statements than making good movies. The truth is it is always very distracting from the unlying stories. This is what I come away from with most of his movies. He distracts by throwing in stuff that is unnecessary to the story line for me. If you like Costner it is COSTNER. on my copy is a sticky note does not leave this house one of Costners greatest movie Do a good job on time ok Very good action adventure depiction of the """"Robin Hood"""" legend and the medieval Crusades period of merry old England. I saw this back in 91 when I was very young and really enjoyed this version or Robin Hood, and still too this very day I have not seen anything top this portrayal of the legendary English hero. Co-star Morgan Freeman is excellent, playing an African Muslim warrior who Robin runs into & saves during the Crusades in the Holy land. Little John is a well portrayed character, Maid Marion is lovely, and Alan Rickman (Die Hard) is also very good as the villainous Sheriff. For what ever reason there seems to be a real hatred and dislike of this movie out there among """"Robin Hood"""" enthusiasts, and for the life of me I cannot understand why??? Even the late Gene Siskel & late Roger Ebert both hated this movie. The old Earl Flynn movie was campy, hokey, and totally lame compared to this realistic and darker classic depicting what life was like in Europe in those days. And Russell Crowe's version of """"Robin Hood""""? Forget it, Crowe's performance was excellent and he is a great actor but the movie around him sucked terribly in comparison to this movie. I also did not care if Costner lacked an """"English"""" accent, his portrayal was powerful and very believable as the leader of a group of regular people just wanting to live in freedom, turning Sherwood forest into their own """"Camelot"""" until the evil Sheriff infiltrates and finds them. Costner is Robin of Lockesly, sent as a soldier on King Richard the Lionheart's Crusade in Jerusalem, where he is captured by these ruthless Arabian dungeon masters who torture and kill with ease. He escapes and frees Morgan Freeman, on a quest to return to his home in England. But when he returns he finds the country is in trouble, when a corrupt group takes power and abuses the peasantry class. When his father is brutally murdered and falsely labeled as a """"Devil Worshiper"""", he swings into action becoming the outlaw archer of legend stealing from the rich and giving to the poor and innocent. This film is filled with very realistic medieval combat action, lots of stunts, romance, and a lot of fine scenery. I enjoyed this movie very much as a fine action adventure flick very worthy of the name, """"Robin Hood"""". Two thumbs up and A for Costner in """"RH Prince of Thieves"""". loved it watch it offen love it Throwback from when my boys were younger! Love this movie! A classic. This is a terrible movie, but I love it. Robin Hood has an american accent, random character from the middle east who is in no other version ever, Snape and Miss Marple getting down with the evil plots, drunken Friar Tuck trying to take on all the merry men on his own, Kevin Costner's naked ass, montage off merry men training. It's the most unsubtle acting ever, they cuss constantly, and basically it's hilarious. Extended scene are kind of cool, but its easy to tell why they got cut. Just more bulk that doesn't add to the movie, really. wish i had seen that it is double sided before ordering it. i watch movies as I run on my elliptical and having to pause my run, get off the machine and turn the disk over was a bit of a pain but otherwise it was a good movie good movie How can you not love this movie? Ok maybe if your born after 1990 you won't like it, but everyone who saw it back in the day as teens, it brings back goofy fun memories and some very memorable sound bytes! so quotable. Plus you get to see Alan Rickman in something where he isn't a large nosed wizard, which is a refreshing change of pace. great Packages arrived very quickly and was exactly as described. Very pleased. Excellent service and merchandise. Purchased this because Alan Rickman """"Snape"""" is in it. I thought Robin Hood Prince of Thieves was a wonderful film. I liked the dark medieval atmosphere and epic music for the film. The Overture music in the opening of the movie is one of the best I have ever heard. I know this film took a lot of heat for not being warm and fluffy like other Robin Hood movies. But the film is geared towards adults and mature audiences this is not for little kids. If you want to watch a happy go lucky Robin Hood movie go watch the Disney's """"Robin Hood"""" or """"Robin Hood Men in Tights"""" with Cary Elwes. That being said this is one of Kevin Costner's best films. Kevin had a string of really good films going in the late 1980's and early 1990's. """"Bull Durham"""", """"Field of Dreams"""", """"Dances with Wolves"""", """"Robin Hood"""" and """"JFK"""" before the wheels fell off into mediocrity of the late 90's and early 2000. Kevin does a good job portraying Robin Hood and I liked the fact that you don't get to see that he was spoiled brat of a youth but the film gives you that idea. When he comes back from the crusades he has a much deeper appreciation for his home and everyone he knew. Kind of a rebellious youth makes good, once becoming a man carrying out justice to those he sees oppressed. That story has been told before but I liked how the director shot the movie. The film is much better paced and has a better overall story than the recent Russell Crowe """"Robin Hood"""" that came out recently. That film mainly focused on the origins of Robin Hoods past, which was interesting and should be given credit for originality, but not much else. It was also a darker film but did not have the heart that Prince of Thieves has. The casting of Prince of Thieves was great on down the line. I especially loved Allen Rickman's portrayal of sheriff Nottingham. He has such a great presence as a villain he can't help but admire his acting. Morgan Freeman was sensational as always and his career really began to take off after this film. I liked that fact that his character portrayed a smart Muslim journeyman honor bound to repay the debt of life given to him, I thought that really enhanced the story. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio played a very convincing Maid Marion and there did seem to be some chemistry between Kevin Costner and Mary. The romantic parts were kind of sappy but I thought they worked overall. The film is long and has an epic feel to it. If you have not seen it before you don't want to miss any parts because the movie covers a lot of ground. I feel like this is the best representation of Robin Hood I have ever seen on film. It may be an adventure ride but it is a fun ride to be on. Whenever it comes on TV I am always hooked into watching the film no matter what part of the movie is on. I think that is what really makes a great movie, when you can sit down at any part of the film and enjoy watching the rest of it. If you like a good story with a lot of action I would recommend Robin Hood Prince of Thieves for sure. its a great clasic To over the top for me. Mel Brooks did a good job making a mockery of this film love this product! comic and sort of dumb good movie wonderful Fantastic Movie. One of my favorites and enjoy the extended copy. Movies is as described and arrived when promised. Great service. very entertaining great movie This was a movie that was stolen by Morgan Freedman playing one of the only sympathetic Muslims in modern film, Well Done! I chose this rating because the last time I saw this movie was On Demand in Streampix. I did loved it, better than the Russell Crowe one. No offense, I got no reasons not to like this version. The facts are about this movie is almost actors I know was in it. Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Christian Slater, Alan Rickman, and Sean Connery (at the end of the film). Anyway, if anyone likes Robin Hood w/ Kevin Costner, this is a must-see. Great movie and Kevin Costner protrayal of the Robin Hood story and charater along with the rest of his staff and the reason he and them came to be. a great movie i thoroughly enjoyed. it is a little on the silly humorous side, but i liked this lightheartedness. the scenery, sets and clothing were all top notch. the actors were as well. a mean, nasty sheriff, friar tuck, little john, robin hood, marion, and the moor, azeem. a great cast. nice light, funny, action movie. loved it. Love Kevin Costner but didn't like this movie. Wasn't want I expected to see. Kevin had done a lot of better movies. I like this movie and it has become one that I watch at least once a year. There are many talented actors and actresses that make this an interesting, amusing and action flick. They have never and will never make a better Robin Hood than this one. This is still the greatest story and movie of Robin Hood. It has your hero, heroine, all the funny people, the serious and the great fighters, or wannabes. I will always love this movie. While I like Kevin Costner, he really was a bit too old for the role. Still, he tried and brought a lot of heart to the movie. Morgan Freeman was great, as always, but the movie belongs to Alan Rickman as the hilariously evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Great movie always a good oboe to watch with award winning cast giving excellent and exciting perfmanced always. That's it.

Done in 1965, the year I was born. I've looked forward to it every year and now I enjoy watching the DVD of it. It's one of my favorites, and the """"kids"""" in it were very professional. Watched this again recently with my wife and my 14 and 16-year olds. We all loved it! The music is so great, the kids are cute, and the story is very satisfying. Love having this movie. My 4 year old granddaughter is now watching it. She likes all the many children and the singing. A wonderful musical movie for movie collections. Definitely one of the best movies ever! Great! Born in 1948 and never saw this before. I'm really glad my mother-in-law wanted it so we could all watch it on Christmas Day. Wonderful music (knew most of the songs already) and a nice story to tie them all together. Simply love it.. I sang along with all the songs from this DVD and even played it over for my nieces (7,9,14) to enjoy. Thank you for sending it early. What a gift. I love this movie and I watch it over and over. It is an exceptional movie and so are the characters who play in the movie. The music is awesome and Julie Andrews does an outstanding job of singing. A truly must watch!!!! The most loved DVD. Children are learning these songs again. I got a copy for my granddaughter because she loves musicals and this is the best in my book. Love this movie. Now it will last longer on DVD. A CLASSIC BEAUTIFUL TALE! XOXOXO It is a wonderful movie and i got another copy. My granddaughter and I watched many times as she grew up - bought for her stocking stuffer now that she is 24. Fun ! A+++ Love this movie one of my favorite musicals. Enjoyable Wonderful movie. Great condition. None The color and film in this BluRay is spectacular! I recommend this. Julie Andrews narrates and appears in one hour as a bonus. I've loved this movie for more since the first time I saw it in the movie house in the sixties. Julie Andrews has a magnificent vocal range and her acting is superb. The settings especially the opening of the movie are grand. I'm hoping my grand daughters will like watching it with us. Favorite movie I am very pleased with this purchase, and recommend it for any others that may be interested in Julie Andrews movies. My mom wanted to see this on Christmas Eve. I had never seen it before, despite knowing most of the music already. I was incredibly surprised how good this HD version looks! I swear, I thought I had accidentally purchased a modern reboot version during the opening flyover shots. So spectacular! The visuals were clear and sharp. You can't tell that it was done in the 1960s! The story is classic and the quality is top notch; why wouldn't you want this? Get it now! My children are as into the movie as I was as a child. It will always be a movie I want to watch even if I've seen it 100 times already. Such a timeless and wonderful movie, that's why we purchased it, so we can watch it at least yearly. The restoration is very good, acting is excellent, music and story line are exceptional. Great movie One of my all time favorite movies Added to a collection of movies my son loved as a child and does to this day and I still love myself. Great clean movie I love this movie, it's a fun to watch with the family. Wonderful classic movie! the best of the best. watch with your whole family Perfect This movie is cute and heartfelt, with great feel-good music, and a story that doesn't get boring despite the long run of 3 hours- but it can get a bit slow. As far as musicals go, """"The Sound of Music"""" is one of the best musicals there is, and it still holds up well despite being an older movie. This is a movie that the entire family can enjoy, since at its heart it is the story of a family healing and sticking together. The cold captain thaws and stops being the emotionally distant and strict father he was to his 7 children (after his wife's death), thanks to Maria's influence. Maria also grows as a character, and learns to face the difficulties that come her way (after being hired as a babysitter for the captain's children), and learns to live her life after being sheltered at a convent. Then there are the children, who want their family back. Overall this is a classic musical, that makes for great family entertainment. On a side note: I own the 40th anniversary edition Bought this classic for my kids, they love it How do you solve a problem like Maria? Orphan kids and handsome dad. I had intended to just share one song with my class and they were mesmerized. Another moment of learning what kids don't know about anymore (it's not just dial telephones: fairy tales, jump rope rhymes, Mary Poppins, Bible stories, Mother Goose, ... ) As described. I will buy again. Great set and very enjoyable. Added to my collection. One of the classics. How could you ever go wrong?? Love it!! A classic. From a simpler time in movie-making, but with a grand scheme. Inspired by a true story. This is a great musical, with excellent acting and beautiful and memorable songs that remain in your mind forever. This is a great movie for a writer to study and learn from, because it is well plotted, with good characters and wonderful music. Richard Shaw is the author Wendy Sayvetz, Judy Collins and Joan Baez - the beauty of folk music (Kindle). the DVD was in great shape. I received it in the proper time frame. I do love this film, thank you.l I bought this for my mom. She loved it. Now that she has passed, we watch it and think of her. Excellent! I should say that I am 41 and had never seen The Sound of Music! How is that possible, right? Well we rented this for a family movie night and we all loved it! I have to say, that now I don't think I want to watch any remakes of it, because I loved the original so much. My daughters are 11 and almost 15 and they thoroughly enjoyed it! I have to say that I was a little surprised that such a classic movie from the past would hold their interest, but they loved it! We will definitely be making this an annual movie for family movie night at our house! GREAT!!! A lovely musical based on a true story. Loved this movie Its become fashionable to make fun of this musical, but the truth is that its still a great movie, great music, and uplifting message. Maria, the young woman who just couldn't make it within the confines of a nunnery, leaves the convent and becomes nanny for a widow with a bazillion cute kids. In his grief and ineptitude, he has been trying to run the household along military lines, and it falls to Maria to add warmth, sunshine, music and love back into their lives. The movie is set in Salzburg during the early years of the Nazi occupation of Austria and is based on the true story of the Von Trapp family. Love, tragedy, drama, suspense, a daring escape over the Alps and joy. Who could ask for more from a film? And then theres the music, the Rogers and Hammerstein score from the Broadway play, which has given us such timeless tunes as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria, My Favorite Things, Edelweiss, So Long Farewell, etc. With Julie Andrews as Maria and Christopher Plummer as the Baron von Trapp, its a winner for all ages. When you think of popular movies, """"The Sound Of Music"""" is definitely going to be on many people's lists. Infact, it's probably the most famous movie of all time, with more than 1 billion people having seen it. The words of the movie title are so famous, and the whole story of the film is just part of cinema legend. When it was released in cinemas back in 1965 it captured the imaginations of all those who viewed it, and this fact still remains by people who view it for the first time today. The scenery of the film, along with the classics songs in it have made The Sound Of Music a legendary experience in cinematic history and an icon out of Julie Andrews. The plot of The Sound Of Music is simple and easy to follow. The film is set in Salzburg, Austria in the last Golden Years of the 1930's before World War II choked Europe. Maria (Julie Andrews) is training to be a nun, but her frequent faltering in obeying tasks causes Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) to re-think Maria's potential position in the Abbey. She sends Maria to Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) to act as a governess and govern his highly eccentric seven children. Since their mother passed away, the seven children have had a string of governesses look after them. All of which could not cope with the demanding task of managing the troublesome seven. Maria reluctantly agrees with Mother Abbess, and makes her way to the household. At first she finds it difficult identifying with the children and getting them to open up, but as time goes by they gradually succumb to Maria's charms and her adorable ways. Over time, Maria poses a problem for Georg's new love interest who plans to marry him for his money. She tries to drive Maria away by embarrassing her at a party, and she does, for a brief while. Maria returns to the Abbey with Mother Abbess, who inspires her to return, no matter what the consequences. The final outcome is one of courage, power, love and the restoration of faith. It's a heart-warming tale of family values that appeals to people of all ages. I loved this film the first time I saw it, and my Grandma loves it even more! Some people think it's corny, but they're the critics who don't like something that achieves success because it's good. It's also a rather camp film, which makes it so much more fun in my eyes. The most famous scene in the film is the opening sequence, where we are given a stunning view of the entire country. The rolling hills, the snow-covered mountain peaks, and the tranquil lakes. The camera moving in to Maria on the hill as she spreads her arms and sings """"The hills are alive, with the sound of music!"""" is just superb. What an opening to a film. From here on, the scenery of the film just continues to expand and grow. The mansion is a beautiful place to live with its surrounding lake, and the city is a picturesque landscape that defines the time and culture. It is almost impossible to review The Sound Of Music without mentioning the music that makes it such a classic film. From the first song, """"The Hills Are Alive,"""" you know this is going to be something spectacular. """"Maria,"""" """"I Have Confidence,"""" """"Sixteen Going On Seventeen,"""" """"My Favourite Things,"""" """"Do-Re-Mi,"""" """"The Lonely Goatherd,"""" """"So Long, Farewell,"""" """"Climb Every Mountain,"""" """"Something Good,"""" and """"Edleweiss"""" are all amazing compositions. It's musical music, and not really something I would usually like, but you just can't help but hum along. You know all the lyrics and have known them for years. They're forever etched into your memory, and you know they're never gonna leave! The Sound Of Music is an exceptional film that everyone should see. It's a film where nothing bad happens.

I don't know if everyone would love this movie, but it's one of my favorites, will watch more than once. Strictly Ballroom is on of Baz Luhrmann's earlier films, and you can see how his filmmaking style was developing. The movie is touching and funny, and a little bid sad at the same time. The acting is campy but authentic, and the characters are interesting. I would recommend this film to anyone who has enjoyed Mr. Luhrmann's later films. This movie is wonderful. One of my absolute favorites. I would recommend it to anyone. I use it in school in a Fine Arts class as a primer on different types of dance and the students, teenagers, love it. This movie will lift you up out of whatever slouch is stalking you this week and send you sailing into the stratosphere. Scintillating and seductive to be sure. Nice twist to ugly duckling story, Good acting, Good dancing and funny look inside of quirky world of ballroom dancing. Great entertainment! Nice movie, young people don't fit in, dance together, very cool, price is right to own comes in blue ray also, Doc I enjoy watching dance movies. This is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone how enjoys ballroom dancing. Great niche film from the early 90's (?) that I never was aware of until lately. A great family movie. """"No new steps!"""" Once you watch this movie you will be saying this over and over in your everyday speech. Great eccentric characters. Highly recommended! Brilliant light comedy: two cliches (ugly duckling becomes swan and artist breaks free of conventions) yet in this lovely film everything seems fresh and new. Wonderful photography coupled with charming music and dance. I have known a middle-aged couple to dance up the aisle after seeing it. Take one part over optimistic love story, add a little goofiness and gaudiness, mix well with lots of great dance scenes and you have """"Strictly Ballroom""""! It's like John Hughes (""""16 Candles"""", """"The Breakfast Club"""") and John Waters (""""Serial Mom"""", """"Desperate Living"""") directed a movie together. Paul Mercurio is a very talented dancer (Principal Dancer with the Sydney Dance Company, founder of the Australian Choreographic Ensemble) --you can tell that he is a real dancer and not just cute actor that they had take lessons for the part. I gave it 3 1/2 stars (because I wish it would've picked one direction to go in, or maybe made the silliness seem like it was being viewed purely through the main character Scott's eyes as he is deciding to take his dancing in another direction) and my husband gave it 4 stars. Top entertainment for anyone who loves to dance or to watch dancing. It is a satire but at bottom celebrates ballroom dancing and those who strive to be the best they can be. Classic dance movie and love story. It's better than watching dancing with the stars. It's s must-see for anyone who likes Baz Luhrman movies. love this movie Wonderful movie! Don't wait any longer! Totally campy feel good movie. It grabbed me right from the beginning. Earlier tonight I went to see a play that was billed as a comedy but turned out to be quite depressing. I left at intermission and needed something to cheer me up before I went to bed. Strictly Ballroom was just the ticket. This """"Cinderella-type"""" story is fun. Based in a little dusty town in Australia. Full of comedic characters in authority. Offers a tongue in cheek behind the scenes look at how seriously """"ballroom"""" dancing is within the tight knit community. It's fun and full of twists and turns. I've watched this movie numerous times since it first came out years ago and I just love it! Quirky, over-the-top characters in a Cindarella story set in the world of Austrailian competitive ballroom dancing. And, the soundtrack is great too! If you're feeling a little blue and want to snap out of it... see Striclty Ballroom! Even if you're not... see Strictly Ballroom! Ballroom dancing from Baz Luhrmann's earliest work. Gia Carides (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) has a nice part, flamenco dancing, comedy, romance, good stuff! This is about this young man that is a ballroom dancer. His dance partner decides to dance with someone else. He then decides to teach a young girl the dances, but she and her family ended up teaching him some dance moves. His parents and judges gave him a lot of pressure over the new dance steps and who he wanted to dance with. It was a good movie. This is a quirky dance movie that still makes me laugh every time I watch it. The dancing is quite enjoyable. The acting and story are great. This story is very unique in the romantic and dance genre. Combines both in a clever story. Very well directed and acted. I already have a copy of it and it is one of my fav no name movies. But for once...the person I gifted it to said it was """"hilarious"""" thus the 5 stars. I'll never get tired of seeing this movie. Twelve more words do I need, but now four... Three two one. Australian movie and the words are sometimes a bit difficult to understand. But the script is so corny and the outcome so heart-warming. I've watched it a number of times. After seeing this movie once, I knew that I had to own it. It is a great ensemble piece - rather like Moonstruck. All of the actors are believable, even the young kids! The magic and passion of true dancing come alive in this movie! I have always loved this movie and I am so glad that I have it on DVD now! This movie cracks me up! I don't wanna talk about the movie cause there will be no one who will choose to buy this movie in a bluray without knowing why we should buy this. I am very dissapointed and almost about to throw out this Bluray right after i see the first two minutes. It is even way worse then the DVD that I own for a long long time. The video quality is so so so bad that I cannot even compare to any other movies that I own in Bluray. ( I have over 1000 Bluray discs) Most of the Lurman's Bluray Re-Release were all very good transfered ones so I believed this might be as good as others. No sir. I just waste my money and time waiting this disc to be arrived. I am so so mad at the releasing company. Please trust me and do not buy this bluray unless you never bought this movie and you like this film. If you own this movie in a DVD or VHS, save your money. A really good way to pass a couple of hours. Another story of dancing, similar to DANCE WITH ME, that has a feel good ending. I really enjoy ballroom dancing.

Really though we'd gotten past this kind of problem. The window for returns closed two weeks ago. I'm going to order another one and play it on receipt; if this happens again I'd like to know why just me - or is anyone else having QC issues with this particular release... A terrific movie, I caught the tail end of it once, got to see it in its entirety and decided to add it to my collection, it never fails to bring a smile to my face, a great flick...Eths Had seen the film before ordering it. For the year it was made it is a fun movie about the evolution of ballroom competition. Okay, I'm going to dust the cobwebs off this 1992 comic musical and encourage you to watch Scott Hastings do his """"crowd-pleasing steps!"""" then thrill to the sound of one lone pair of trembling hands as it claps in that echoing ballroom. Goosebumps every time! Australian Baz Luhrmann (""""Australia"""") launched his Red Curtain Trilogy with this sweet, goofy, romantic, cartoon of a musical. The other two in this trio are """"Romeo and Juliet"""" (1996) and """"Moulin Rouge!"""" (2001). All three are conceived and developed with only one thing in mind: The Audience. And that's US! These wonderful actors make it happen: * Paul Mercurio (""""Joseph"""") is Scott Hastings, son of the proprietors of a struggling ballroom dance studio. His father is a hen-pecked sad sack, while his mother is an ambitious spark plug. They both agree that """"this is Scott's year to win the Australian Pan Pacific Championships"""" and bring glory to their studio. * Barry Otto (""""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"""") is Scott's father, quietly melting into the woodwork, as his wife runs the show. * Pat Thomson (""""Phar Lap"""") is fearless as Shirley Hastings, Scott's mother who is tone deaf to everything but her own ambition. I'm sorry to say that she died the same year this film was completed and we lost a fine actress. * Tara Morice (""""Razzle Dazzle"""") is Fran, the poor student stuck in Beginners, who has aspirations... She does janitorial work to pay for her lessons. It is Scott who asks her, """"Do you think you could dance without those glasses?"""" (I LOVE clichs!) * Bill Hunter (""""Finding Nemo"""") is Barry Fife, who disqualifies Scott for not using Federation-approved dance steps. Hunter, who died in 2011, was part of Australia's acting aristocracy. As you can tell, the plot swirls around an upcoming Ballroom dance contest, with Scott in a frantic search for a new dance partner, as his has been stolen away by the reigning champ. Fran wants to audition, but she's a Beginner! Be prepared to completely buy into this plot, root for the good guys, hiss at the bad ones, watch Fran's father do an amazing Paso Doble with his mother-in-law (Fran's grandmother), and thrill to some spectacular ball- room dancing with stunning costumes. (Luhrmann's parents danced in Ballroom competitions, so he knows whereof he speaks.) I've owned this DVD for years and it's almost worn"""	Strictly Ballroom

These Steelbooks are absolutely stunning! I love them! It took me a long time to decide which Star Wars set to go with, and I have no regrets. Perfect for display! *** This review may contain spoilers *** Watched my favorite Movie of All time Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi which in My opinion The Greatest Movie of All time. The Cast Was Stellar With Mark Hamill(Britannia Hospital) as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford(Blade Runner) as Han Solo ,Carrie Fisher(The Blues Brothers) as Leia Organa, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca, Jermey Bulloch(George & Mildred) as Boba Fett, Billy Dee Williams(Colt .45 ) as Lando Calrrission, Anthony Daniels (Bashki's Lord Of The Rings) as C- 3PO, Kenny Baker(Flash Gordon) as R2-D2 Denis Lawson(Bitter Cherry) as Wedge Antilles, Dermot Crowley(Giro Ciy) as General Madine , Caroline Blakiston(Les Miserables) as Mon Mothma, Tim Rose(Just William) & Erik Bauersfield as Admiral Ackbar, Michael Pennington(Cymbeline) as Moff Jerjerrod ,Kenneth Colley (Firefox) as Admiral Piett ,Frank Oz(The Muppet Movie) as Yoda, , David Prowse(Doctor Who) & James Earl Jones(Conan The Barbarian) as Darth Vader ,Ian McDiarmid(A Performance Of Macbeth) as Emporer Palpatine/Darth Sidious and Sir Alec Guinness(The Bridge On The River Kwai) as Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi,. The Film is Great has one of the best intros as Vader's Shuttle Approaches The Death Star II. The Film is the best out of the Star Wars Saga with The High Octane Action Adventure and Compelling Characters with a brilliant Story and fantastic visuals and the best Emotional Conflict Between Vader,Luke Skywalker and The Emporer as well as The Rebel Alliances Final Assault on The Death Star II , Fantastic Cinematography by Alan Hume(Eye Of The Needle), Production Design By Norman Reynolds(Phase IV) ,Amazing Writing By Lawrence Kasdan(The Big Chill) ,Direction By Richard Marquand(The Legacy), Fantastic Costume design from Aggie Guerard Rodgers(American Graffiti) & Nilos Rodis-Jamero and Amazing Score from John Williams(Indiana Jones and The Raiders Of The Lost Ark) definitely one of my favorite movies ever 10/10 needed dvd replacement for vhs This movie is the weakest of the original trilogy. The plan to free Han Solo from Jabba the Hut was absurd, and the gorilla war tactics use by the Ewoks against the Empire troopers were ridiculous. This DVD does include the theatrical version of the film which was a nice bonus. Great movie. Good moral and ethics undertones. Fathers are not always what you think they are. They are as complex and twisted as the children. I'm not quite sure why the producers felt it was necessary to dumb down and cute up this final episode of the trilogy. I will agree that """"The Empire Strikes Back"""" is a downer on so many levels but it created the entire mythology surrounding """"Star Wars"""" and established the films as intelligent, well-acted and tragic - something the Academy Awards refused to see because it was sci-fi but, all things told, do the Oscars really judge quality? When you exempt an entire genre, there's something wrong with the Academy. Anyway, we have in """"Return of the Jedi"""" something akin to a redaction of much of """"Empire"""". The opening scene with Jabba is made unduly long with the addition of footage previously cut. It makes the escape sequence much more comical which, in itself, is not bad since """"Star Wars"""" does have a tradition of humorous moments but it undercuts Luke who, by this time, has the power to do whatever he really wants. And then there are the Ewoks. Cute as a button when I saw this film first in the theaters at age five but irritating and, at the base of it, again entirely at Luke's whim. Had the Rebels landed on a planet with more rational and skeptical alien life forms, it would have made for a tenser and more challenging situation. All this aside, the tension is there - when are they going to destroy the shield? When is the Emperor going to succeed in enslaving Luke to his ends? And what can Luke's sister do? These underlying questions, and others surely, help to create the action and suspense that were so critical to the other """"Star Wars"""" episodes. In the end, this is still a classic but I don't believe it's unreasonable to have asked for more. 5 stars!!! added to our collection works great highly recommended good we need the original version anamorphic remastered on blu ray This is not the original theatrical version!! I was very disappointed to realized I'd been conned into the re-released theatrical version. This includes the terrible edits and horrific band scene. Please please please Disney release the actual original version so I can show my kids what Star Wars was when I fell in love with it!! It was great to see this iconic movie in full instead of just little snippets on the TV, which is what I saw growing up. Jabba the Hutt is a classic character and the beginning area in his palace is definitely a must-watch from Star Wars. The finale is amazing! For those interested in the Jedi, the Sith, and Darth Vaders journey as shown in later Star Warsthis is where it all began. The last moments between Luke and his father brought tears to my eyes, and as a new-generation fan I actually liked the added scenes that tie into the later movies. I don't watch a lot of movies from this era and the 80s style isn't for me visually. But its a good movie. good really good. I like it because the 2nd death star, and admiral ackabar............ '' its a trap!'' I wish I could have got the original. The Jaba-disco scene is painful :( so many additions in this version that are unnecessary or outright grating... Very good thank you very much I didn't understand this movie. It starts off in such a manner that I feel there should have been a movie or two before it, so people could have some kind of backstory to the characters. Maybe even three movies before those two. And maybe three more after this one. Possibly, a lifetime of side narratives would be helpful too. Maybe two computer animated series would also aid in fleshing out this stand alone sci-fi movie, as well a cartoon in the 80's about the friendly teddy bears in this one. Just some ideas. Great Movie. Old School/Age of the Geek . """"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"""" is the third film from the """"Star Wars"""" franchise and the sixth in terms of chronology. It was made 6 years after the original and was the first that did not win any Oscars, but still scored 4 nominations. Fans of the possibly biggest franchise in film history often consider this one the weakest from the 3 early films, but I cannot agree with this sentiment. It may even be my favorite from the trio. They included many interesting new characters, elaborated nicely on the old ones and there is one of the most famous villains in film history in here. The locations are fairly great to watch as well. The film is pretty long, runs for roughly 135 minutes, but there was rarely a moment when I felt it dragged and to me it also seemed as if most of the actors have stepped up their games by 1983. George Lucas only appears as writer in here and the director is Richard Marquand, probably not a name to too many outside the Star Wars universe. Unlucky for him, he also died way too early. But I think he did a fairly memorable job here. What I liked the most about his film here are probably all the colorful, memorable characters, especially the cute furry ones. But the film also delivers on the dramatic side, especially in terms of Yoda and in terms of tragedy involving core characters. And for the great sci-fi lovers, there are also many great locations in space and spectacular special effects sequences. It was fantastic It's a good one that wasn't too oooo butchered. Great edition case. Basic Blu ray, only. No extra special features or DVD copy (which would be great so my kids could watch on Thier systems when they want). But for a collector, it's a must have. Can't say enough good things about the case, itself. The art is the best I've seen. The Steel Book is amazing, impossible not to love it! Perfect idea for a gift. Love the movie today. And I really liked it as a kid. Luke Skywalker you go. Best trilogy ever!!!!! A classic. I really enjoyed the little ewoks... cute little teddy bears. The flying through the forest on those motor bikes was the best scene of any action film I've ever seen. EPIC!!! I didn't understand this movie. It starts off in such a manner that I feel there should have been a movie or two before it, so people could have some kind of backstory to the characters. Maybe even three movies before those two.

Terrific DVD! GOODFELLAS IS NOT THE BEST MOVIE IT GLORIFIES EVIL Obviously, a sensational package for longtime Scorsese fans or casual fans who like """"a good movie"""". You've got a Classic, """"Goodfellas""""; a near-Classic, """"Aviator"""", and a wanna-be Classic, """"The Departed"""", ironically, the one to finally win an Oscar for the Director. Nothing in Life is perfect and even """"Goodfellas"""" had an overproduced soundtrack - I guess MTV was in full swing - not that the music was interpolated poorly. """"Aviator"""", mostly about Howard Hughes' life in flying, was too long, had an over-studied (but effective) """"Kate Hepburn"""" and a slightly obscure treatment of """"Jane Russell""""; plus some of the script anachronisms were almost funny; also, DiCaprio seems to age about six years out of 20: 1927 to 1947. I found the opening scene, involving a """"Germophobic"""" Mother, somewhat confusing. By the end of the movie, we understand that Howard Hughes, was probably a victim of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, which current research says is congenital, not something conditioned. Gotta ruminate on that for a while: were the movie-makers saying that it ran in the family or that his quest for purification was based upon a childhood memory? Problems abound with """"The Departed"""" (unofficial alternate title: """"The Mean Streets Of Boston""""), as no-one is as they seem. That, in itself, shouldn't *be* a problem, but here it gets out of hand. Nicholson is the conflicted """"Boss""""; Sheen is the conflicted """"Sergeant""""; DiCaprio is the undercover guy; Damon is the corrupt climber who takes over for Sheen, who watches DiCaprio. DiCaprio and Damon look like first Cousins - curious casting. Nicholson looks more like Attila The Hun than the expected underworld sophisticate. His mistress is a radical feminist - believable? No. Forgot to mention that DiCaprio's """"Shrink"""", Vera Farmiga, can be cajoled into writing prescriptions, convinced that sleeping with a patient is appropriate, and that moving in with Damon is fitting. I think Scorsese got a little lazy on this one: he must have watched """"Goodfellas"""" with DiCaprio one too many times and possibly over-sold the idea of copying Ray Liotta. A great imitation, though. Boy, did I miss Paul Sorvino! Special Features on """"Goodfellas"""" is especially exciting, as it features a running commentary with the Director, the Cionematographer, DeNiro, Sorvino, Bracco, Liotta, the """"real"""" Henry Hill and the """"real"""" Prosecutor, Ed McDonald (who played himself in the film!), plus a combination of the real and movie Hills! At times, Henry Hill's narration will have you spellbound, as he """"relives"""" events. By the way, I was unaware that so many scenes were """"close to home"""". Overall, this DVD set is a gem. Good for the movie buff *and* his/her billfold. I was roaming about in a local Target yesterday when I wandered into the electronics section. Looking at the DVDs, I saw """"4 Film Favorites: Martin Scorsese Collection"""" on sale for $7.99. Four movies - """"Mean Streets,"""" """"Goodfellas,"""" """"The Aviator,"""" and """"The Departed"""" - from a world class director for a mere $7.99. That's less than two bucks for each title. I bought it, but only for """"Goodfellas"""" which is my favorite Scorsese film and one of my favorite films period. It was only later that I looked up this set at Amazon. I was shocked to see so many one and two star reviews. Were these discs manufactured from inferior prints? Were all four movies crammed onto one disc? What could be the problem? The problem, according to these customers, is that """"Goodfellas"""" is truncated. When it first appeared on DVD, the nearly three hour film was divided into two parts, with one part on side one and the remainder of the film on side two. When putting together this set, the manufacturer apparently was unaware of that and only side one made it onto the disc. Only after reading these reviews did I unseal the package and open the container to see what was inside. There were four discs, one for each film. However, """"Goodfellas"""" was labeled """"Disc One."""" Uh-oh. Where was """"Disc Two""""? Since """"Disc One"""" had poster art reproduced on one side, I concluded that this wasn't a double-sided disc. I have never had a double-sided disc that had artwork on the label. I was disappointed. I felt like I had been ripped-off. I only bought this set for """"Goodfellas"""" and I wasn't going to get the complete movie. """"Heck,"""" said I (well, I actually muttered another word, a euphemism for excrement, but I won't type that here). There was only one thing left to do: insert """"Disc One"""" of """"Goodfellas"""" into my Bluray player and fast forward through each chapter to see if the movie abruptly ended, as that two-sided disc did, shortly after the murder of Billy Batts. Hmm. Clicking the """"display"""" option on the remote, I discovered there were 47 chapters which seemed about right for a nearly three-hour movie. The display also said the film's running time was 146 minutes, the same running time provided at the Internet Movie Database. As I sped through each chapter I glimpsed many familiar scenes and when I reached the end, there was Ray Liotta getting his newspaper from the steps of his modest new digs, and addressing the viewer, telling us how his new life does not compare with life in the mob. Then Joe Pesci briefly appeared to blast away at the screen before it faded to black and Johnny Rotten (or whoever that is) sings """"My Way"""" over the closing credits. Unless someone received a defective edition of this set, the complaints are unwarranted. """"Goodfellas"""" is here in its entirety and all on one disc. Unless you already have these movies, this set is a steal for the price and well worth owning. The comments say it's only half of goodfellas yet, just do a Google search on how long each movie is, add them together and you get only two minutes missing. lol Since there aren't any tailors i doubt there is only half a movie. How many four film favorites has this company came out with and how many 'half movies' did they release? NONE that i got. So i'm going to get the film and write to see if these comments are misleading which i strongly think they are. Love these films to death! Some of my absolute favorites! The product packaging and shipping were excellent! Thank you So much! I would highly recommend this seller! Thank you so much again ! This is a good DVD to add to your collection. Well packed, Good price as well. SW This is a great deal. Three discs for less than ten bucks is hard to beat! Excellent product! My all time favorite movies of Martin Scorsese, finally on one collection box set. All 3 blu-ray disc is pack with a lot of special features, three languages (English, Spanish and francais) and the quality of the image is amazing. A great gift. On time, works great. 3 Martin Scorsese movies for just $14. Can't beat that. Since I bought a few more I paid 0$ for shipping which is always nice & that I recommend unless you're a PRIME member ! Great deal for 4 quality movies. Great triple pack, and you can't beat the price. It's worth the price for GoodFellas alone. Bought used. The Departed froze up 20 minutes in, very bummed. Goodfellas was perfect. Aviator not a big priority. Everything was great as always. Thanks I love the first two movies outright. """"Aviator"""" is okay, but my particular copy managed to lose the color """"green"""". A large chunk of the movie had """"BLUE"""" grass and leaves. I thought it was my TV, but it was Blu-Ray transfer. And the problem was even in the special features showing those scenes. Strange. Three classic films on Blu Ray sit back and enjoy! Three great movies for one great price! I couldn't resist. I already had Goodfellas on DVDS and upgraded to BluRay a few years ago. But I wanted the other two movies also. This was a great deal, I think. I love this wow just like in the movies action packed get your popcorn ready it is going to be a long night. How could I pass up three of the best films of the past thirty years all in one collection? I couldn't. Goodfellas and The Departed are the director's best films in my opinion. Excellent product. wonderful works of scorsese I had to start consolidating my DVD and Blue Ray collection because I was running out of room and I personally do not like the cloud, though I do have less important movies piling up on hard drives now as well. This was a great way to get these four great movies in one sleeve. The Good Fellas original DVD was in a paper back case which is wider than standard DVDs and sticks out on the shelf. I am kind of OCD and that drives me crazy so I was very happy with this compilation. My family had mixed reviews on this DVD. Loved the movie the Departed. Was a good value instead of buying them separately. Each movie played well and was complete. So as i stated before i will see if this movie was only 'half' of goodfellas. It's not. It's the entire films, however it does require you to flip the disc just like 'Schindler's list' does. It doesn't require you to start it however, just FLIP the movie and two seconds later it starts on it's own. The flip i think happens around after one of the 'bosses' was killed in the bar by Joe P. lol I for me it's cool because the movie is good regardless. But please just know you will have to flip the cd over at one point. after that, it plays all the way through and nothing else is required. These movies are not really comparable. 'Goodfellas' continues Scorcese's fascination with the underworld and that milieu's tensions, rivalries and secrets generate great tension and fear. Mann's 'Heat' on the other hand revolves around the near symbiotic relationship of a cop and a criminal. They even have a meal together at Kate Mantolini's! A feeling of doom hangs over both these 'professionals'. Love it!! What a way to get several movies for the price of one! Thank you Amazon!!!! Great movies DO NOT BUY, THIS OFFER. 1/2 GOODFELLAS IS MISSING """"NOT THERE"""" NADA... This was a gift to a Leonard DiCaprio fan and the recipient was extremely happy with the quality and content. I was informed this movie package would be recommended to all. Goodfellas and the aviator are two of my favorite movies. Have not checked out the other two but i will. These dvds arrived on time and were in great shape. Goodfellas is one of the best mob stories ever and the acting is perfection. The Aviator was extraordinary as was the departed. Mean Streets tells a gritty story in true Scorsese fashion. One was excellent and one was loaded with F-bombs. I haven't watched the other two yet. I think it is disgusting that a sentence can't be completed without one of these bombs in it. If there was a way to rate this any lower, I would. The Goodfellas movie is incomplete. They only give you half of the movie. I had no idea buying this was just a preview pack but apparently it is. Do not buy this product - you have been warned!!! WB needs to improve their quality assurance department. Either that or they get jollies off of ripping people off. I paid all that money for an incomplete movie. That just blows my mind. Great movie's!!! It has some of Scorsese's best movies and I loaned it to a friend. I hope to get it back sometime in the future. awesome movies. worth the price love these 4 film favorites its ok 2 great movies for the price"""	GoodFellas

Movies only, no extras. Each one in a little over 4 gbs; the standard single-layer format. Disc 2 is a Dual-Layer with the Extended Version of Stripes and all its original extra material. Not bad, especially for the price. The only thing that would have made it better would have been: 3 Dual-Layer discs with proper transfers and extras for all 3 movies. But if you are that picky...get the BluRay discs (right?). A nice set of Bill Murray classics! Nice box set for Bill Murry yearly, classic comedies. A little bit dated but fun and relaxing. Great to have 3 movies w bill murray The DVD came in excellent condition. That said, I have no interest in """"Ghostbusters"""". """"Groundhog Day"""" is one of my five favorites! """"Stripes"""" is adequate. The three pack was/is cheaper than purchasing just buying """"Groundhog Day"""" alone... Love all three of these films. We will watch Groundhog Day in the midst of summer just because it is so fun. One of our favorite Bill Murray movies. We purchased this simply for Groundhog Day but how can you pass up Stripes and Ghost Busters too. Great deal. Awesome comedies. AAAAAA++++++ Classic 80's comedies that are still laugh out loud movies. Highly recommend it. The extended scenes in Stripes is worth purchasing on it's own as I've never seen it available elsewhere. 3 great movies. Great quality dvd's. WOW! Three great Bill Murray movies under one roof.

The confrontation sparks off Tetsuo's supernatural power leading to bloody death  a coup attempt and the final battle in Tokyo Olympiad where Akira's secrets were buried 30 years ago.Action Adventure Animation Sci-Fi , action animal-movie animated animation anime atmospheric bloody brutality complex cult-classic cyberpunk dark dialogue distopia dystopia dystopic-future enigmatic future futuristic good-soundtrack gory graphic-novel hallucinatory imdb-top-250 intense japan masterpiece original post-apocalyptic science-fiction scifi social-commentary storytelling stylish stylized tokyo violence violent visceral visual visually-appealing visually-stunning weird ,""AKIRA is the benchmark Japanese animated film, instilling an intelligence and uncharacteristic adult element into the false world of cell animation. The results are breathtaking. Each bit of trash, each shard of glass, each drop of sweat is amazingly animated, giving AKIRA a highly realistic, yet fantastical, look and feel. Set in post-World War 3 Tokyo, AKIRA tells the story of two boyhood friends who become entangled in a government experiment to harness the power of the human lifeforce, an attempt to speed up the human evolution. One of these friends, a young and mistreated boy named Tetsuo, finds himself the unwilling guinea pig in these experiments. He developes strong telekinetic powers and sets out to seek revenge upon those who have put him down and made him feel inferior. All this strong emotional material is set against a chaotic backdrop of a city in the midst of revolution. Protests and terriorist bombings sparks the streets, sidewalk preachers scream out their gospel, all while the government and the army fight to keep control. It's strong stuff, aimed at adults, with oodles of violence and true, thought-provoking questions. The ending is a bit convoluted for most, highly reminescent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001, but nothing can quite ruin the 100 minutes that preceed it. What transpires is a work of art that is extremely fascinating and genuinely exciting. This is a startling example of the power of animation and deserves to be viewed as a true film and not just a cartoon. But this is for thinking audiences only. DOn't expect any talking bunnies. Do expect a massive adrenaline rush. Wow. Finally we are presented with the DVD version of this fantastic movie. I was beginning to lose faith in the system... But it's not all good since even after all this time the people who are putting out this epic on DVD have failed by making the 5.1 version in English and the Stereo in Japanese which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to me! The first thing that comes to mind is: ARE THEY MENTAL? Of course I'll still buy it. I've been waiting for this for an excrutiatingly long time and a minor mistake (yeah right, who am I kidding) like this isn't going to detter me. Still I am very disappointed. Obviously the movie itself is of such enormous awesomeness I can't even describe it (esp. any better than the previous reviewers who did an excellent job). All I can say is please buy this movie if you buy one movie in your entire existance and watch it many many times. You will not regret it. Definetely a tremendous landmark in the history of all animation and still the single best animation movie of all time (yes i do enjoy some of the older Disney movies but there is just no comparison). If you have this movie and need a good anime fix, please also acquire Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke, Grave of the Fireflies, and Ninja Scroll (these are in order from best to not so best since all are amazing and of course this is only my opinion but I'm sure you'll agree after watching each one). First of all, if you haven't seen """"Akira"""" before, STOP READING and BUY the disc already. It really is the pinnacle of Japanimation, as far as I'm concerned. The cels are dazzling, and nothing has even approached the minute detail of this film, and it was made in the late Eighties! If you HAVE seen the initial English dub released around 1990, then you are in for an interesting ride because this is a completely different film. The dialogue is not only done by new actors, but nearly every line is changed from the previous dub. One obvious change is pronuciations of the character's names: """"Akira"""" isn't """"uh-KEE-ruh,"""" as in the first English dub. Now, it's pronounced, """"AH-kee-dah,"""" with the DAH spoken as a hard """"R."""" Kaneda isn't """"kah-NAY-dah,"""" but """"KAH-nah-dah."""" It takes a bit of getting used to if you've seen the original English dub as many times as I have, but it's still a classic piece of animation that can still blow your mind every bit as much as it did in 1990. I recommend this version, although since I am still very much fond of the previous version, I would have liked it if they included the first English dub in a separate audio track. But alas, I am just grateful to see """"Akira"""" back on the market so that anime fans, new and old, can continue to appreciate this master work. In America, we tend to think of animated films as cartoons. The Disney imprint comes to mind first, and for some that is the extent of it. For more serious devotees, the infamous Warner Brothers works, the Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson comedic less-than-one reelers are held in equal esteem with Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd. Several films require a different way of thinking about animation as an art form: Rock and Rule (long out of print), Fantastic Planet, Light Years, the brilliant failure of the first Heavy Metal, and yes, both versions of Fantasia. Akira is in a class by itself. This film is the reason I wanted a DVD player. More than The Cell, The Matrix or Dark City. More than Welles's films, or Hitch's, or even Kurosawa's. This film is proof that cgi's are not the be-all and end-all of the animated film. One complaint: The manga series covers much more ground than the film. Where is the sequel? """"Akira"""" is one of those exceptional moments when an art form transcends itself and becomes something greater. It is one of the few anime's to be viewed by the """"mainstream."""" It defines animation in the way that """"Watchmen"""" defines comic books, """"The Empire Strikes Back"""" defines science fiction, or """"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"""" defines wuxia, as something to strive for and not quite achieve. It is a watermark. That's some pretty flowery praise, but """"Akira"""" deserves it. Inside this movie is some of the best, most crisp and exiting animation ever captured on film. There are so many stunning moments (the battle with the clowns, the sewer race, Tetsuo's battle with the army, Kaneda's race to save his friend, the background of Neo-Tokyo) backed up with an exceptional soundtrack that blends techno music with traditional Japanese styles. The story line is traditional anime, with an explosive mixture of youth and technology juxtaposed with the traditional need to impose order on chaos. The characters are both righteous and stupid, heroic and annoying, competent and naive. Ah heck, just watch it! Seeing """"Akira"""" get this collector's edition DVD treatment is like seeing the Mona Lisa get her own room at the Louvre. All you can say is """"it's about time."""" This was the first Anime film that I had the pleasure to view. My very first experience with anime was watching the old """"Starblazers"""" series on TV. I enjoyed that show, but it seems like nothing compared to Akira. Light years beyond anything that I viewed previously, seeing this sumptuous film in the theatre was an indescribably wonderful experience, it blew me away. It opened my eyes to a whole new world of animation that has steadily grown in popularity in my country. Finally, this great film will be in a DVD format, it is about time! The artwork and story of Akira will astound anyone, not just anime fans. Buy this DVD. How long have I been waiting for this? Too long. I am very excited to see the coolest Anime ever come out on Region 1 DVD. This movie is so creative and enrapturing, I personally prefer to listen to the Japanese tracks, but I am an uber-freak. The science fiction aspect of this movie is awesome and creative and the animation is very cleaver and realistic. If you have not seen this movie, then you must! This is one of those few movies that you can truly say that there is nothing else like it. Akira achieves everything an anime fan wants. Great, lovable characters, a moving storyline, atmospheric settings, and plenty of surprises. There is, actually, little more to say about this without spoiling it for newcomers. What I can say is that this is the model for introducing either yourself or someone you know to the anime artform. When I first saw this movie, back in the 80's, I loved it. Now that a lot of time has gone by and I'm older, I watched it again. And I still love it. To re-arrange one person's very admirable review: """"It takes a very open mind to enjoy this movie. Akira draws fanatics too bloodthirsty to appreciate its message, and scares away critics intelligent enough to understand it. All in all, be careful with this movie; it's not for everyone. Just ignore the hype on BOTH sides (pro and con) and judge for yourself."""" While this film condenses a long pre-existing manga (comic book) storyline, the movie's plot may seem """"chunked together"""" at times. The film is filled with gritty violence to appease the blood-and-guts fans while they have """"some morality shoved down their throats"""". The new DVD picture quality is """"heads and shoulders"""" above that of the original VHS/LD/VCD version. The film negative has been digitally cleaned up to remove scratches and dirt. The colors are so vivid and rich in this version. The picture actually looks BETTER than it would have when the film was brand new (in a theater in 1988). This version's picture may be the most vivid, rich and colorful animation work I have ever seen. This DVD version looks and sounds the way every version of Akira should. I would highly recommend this version to any and all Akira fans. I would highly recommend this title to anime or science fiction fans, but simply recommend it to everyone else. The animation equals or exceeds Disney's current BEST. And this film came out in 1988! I have a small collection of movies in UMD format, and I try to collect any anime releases that come out in that format. Some of the releases are disappointing. For example, Ghost in the Shell and Ninja Scroll (both Manga releases) have no extra features - no choice of audio track, no subtitles, rudimentary menus, and and overall """"soft"""" image quality. Ninja Scroll is also presented in the controversial """"wide screen"""" version even though the original film was in a 4:3 aspect ratio. All in all, Manga has given short shrift to the UMD format, bringing out barely adequate releases. Geneon, on the other hand, has produced superior products in their UMD releases. Akira and Appleseed (both Geneon releases) act and feel like their big brother DVDs. Interesting menus, audio tracks in both the original Japanese and English, and English subtitles. Picture quality is razor sharp, the way it should be for the PSP's superior screen. The Akira UMD has very good stereo imaging, and a crisp image. If you are a fan of this landmark anime you will be pleased by the excellent presentation that Geneon has given it in the UMD format. A classic anime film, influential. I'm glad it is now available in this amazing Blu Ray DVD. AMAZING!! watch it and buy it. It is a must have in your collection. ahead of his time. A masterpiece! It took three years for the anamorphic conversion to come out on laser disk and was well worth the wait then, and is still a great work of Anime! It was a """"cartoon"""" that told an epic story when it was released, and is considered the grandfather of Anime Drama to this day. About 2 years ago is when I rented """"Akira"""". I am very fond of actor, Cam Clarke, who plays Kaneda in the original, so 2 years later, when this so called """"Special Edition"""" came out on DVD, I rented it to see it. I"""	Akira

The august artistic vision of Misters Merchant and Ivory is awe-inspiring. I'd place their achievement at number one atop my list of favorite films--which is no mean feat as there are at least 100 that I'd rate with five stars. The production is pure transcendence and bears little in relation to normal life. Where does one begin regarding """"A Room with a View""""? So many themes are developed in these two hours, such as the way that love is forged in times of danger and stress along with nature's power to undermine societal repression. It is one of the few movies that is stronger than the book upon which it is based. It can be interpreted as pure romance and also, independently, as a satire on the Victorian age. I saw it the theatre for the first time at age 17, and it continues to haunt me eighteen years later. This movie launched Julian Sands, Simon Callow, and Daniel Day Lewis as serious actors. It also features British acting legends like Denholm Elliott, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. Overall, there is not one bad performance in this film. As if it needed any more recommendations, the soundtrack is also extraordinary. You must own this film. It is not a rental. Helena Bonham-Carter, as Lucy Honeychurch, is a paragon of joyous feminity that few on this earth are capable of living up to. She is an ideal as are all of these characters. This is a depiction of romantic love rarely found on the big screen. You vividly see the passion that forms between George and Lucy, and its force is infinitely believable. The way in which the audience is allowed to witness their attraction is quite rare. In comparison, a strong film like """"Sense and Sensibility"""" becomes weak tea. You cheer for these lovers and long to know what happens in the future. If all lives were like these, then every death would become calamitious tragedy. This movie is the closest many of us will ever come to the sublime. ...if you have the least interest in this film-BUY the new DVD. It's simply amazing. I've scanned these reviews here, and apparently there was an earlier DVD issue that wasn't up to par at ALL-but rest assured, this reasonably-priced """"Special Edition"""" looks and sounds crisp, clean-and stunningly beautiful. Obviously I loved the film when it was originally released, and plenty of others did as well-see reviews below. But watching this new DVD the other night, I was struck at how amazing this movie really is: in the first place, it's rare(to put it mildly!)for a film nearly 20 years old to not look """"dated"""" at ALL-this one doesn't. It could have been shot yesterday. I'd be willing to bet that in 15 years """"Shakespeare in Love"""" *will* look somehow """"late '90s""""-it's the norm for period costume pieces to wind up reflecting the styles of the times they were made, even if we can't see it without the distance of years passing. What an achievement, then for James Ivory, Ismail Merchant, and the designers/cinematographer/costumer...and the actors-! Superb, all of them. The second audio track is, I'm afraid, a little superfluous(although it was enjoyable to hear the producers chatting away with Simon Callow-""""the Rev. Beebe""""-and the only actor to record commentary, alas)...but it doesn't matter a whit. Truly one of those things where everything came together perfectly. If you buy this, you'll have a great shot at converting a few jaded kids(assuming you've got some around the house)to the glories of another time and place, and *real* romance(and just about the sexiest kisses you could ask for). Enjoy! This is such a fabulous film for so many reasons that it's difficult to list them all. First, it is a sumptuous visual feast. The scenes of the English countryside, the costuming, the furnishing of the Edwardian homes...if you have the slightest interest in wallowing in such lucious detail; you'll be happy with that aspect of the film alone. Second, there is the equally rich acting...whatever these actors were paid could not have measured up in any way to what they gave. Daniel Day Lewis, Helena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, and Judi Dench are only the best known members of a cast that truly, truly dazzles the viewer in this film. The script is fresh and witty; the directing perfection; and the soundtrack alone can move you to tears. All highest praise!! I saw this film when it first came out, in the theater, and it has remained one of my favorite films. It was the first film I bought when I got a VCR. This is one of those elegant Merchant-Ivory productions (which also include Maurice and A Passage to India, other E.M. Forster adaptations to film) that sets the late Victorian/early twentieth century world in upper- to upper-middle class England in such gracious light. The stars of this film include Helena Bonham Carter as Lucy, the heroine, and Julian Sands as George Emerson, her free-spirited suitor, who shocks everyone by doing such risque things as running around without a jacket, or kissing someone (willing) in a field of poppies. The official suitor of Lucy is the stuffed-shirt Cecil Vyse, whose personality seems like it is jammed in a vise. There are great performances by Judi Dench (as a conventional free-spirit, one who likes to be freespirited but not at the expense of reputation), Rupert Graves, Simon Callow, Denhom Elliot, and an outstanding performance (as always, she just has to walk on the set and the film gets an extra star) by Maggie Smith, as the gossipy and fretting aunt and chaperone to Lucy, who eventually comes round to recognizing and rejoicing in the true love of Lucy and George. The sets are beautiful, the costumes all very much a part of the period, as are the small touches that make up the style of English society that Forster was trying to expose and celebrate in different ways both at the same time. The music is enchanting, with the glorious opera piece """"O Mio Bambino Caro"""" sung by Kiri te Kanawa. If u fancy a slowmoving picture, filled with beautiful locations, actors, music, period costumes and scipt - this film is the ONE FOR YOU. It`s a funny tale of the almost upper-class British and their philanderings leading to almost a near-tragic outcome(a fatal marriage) hehe. The entire cast and crew is a smashing success. Great movie made from a good book. Rarely happens, but Merchant/Ivory did an incredible job creating this film. Scenery, script, music and acting are all in perfect condition from the original movie. Casting is impeccable: Maggie Smith couldn't be better cast as 'Poor Charlotte'...who is as passive-aggressive as they come. Judi Dench, as always, does a lot w/a little role. But it really is Daniel Day-Lewis, Julian Sands and Helena Bonham Carter who make the movie. Especially Day-Lewis who can annoy the hell out of you and then on a dime make you feel like his heart has actually been shattered. Don't count Rupert Graves, Simon Callow or Rosemary Leach short. All do excellent jobs. Some reviews (from the original released version) have mentioned that the audio was out of synch w/the video. I had this trouble w/this 'special edition' on my mid-priced Sony player - but the DVD plays just fine on my laptop. The 2nd disk is almost not needed. Except for a documentary/video-obituary on E.M. Forester, the extras are horrid. """"A Room With A View"""" is the sumptuous Merchant/Ivory production of E.M. Forster's novel about a young woman, Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) who longs to escape her clausterphobic life. To this end she's drawn to two men of varying virtue; George (Julian Sands) a fiery, passionate dreamer - alive with living, and Cecil (Daniel Day Lewis) the snobbish and stale, though socially acceptable, man about town. This is a fabulous production, elegantly mounted and rich in stellar acting and performances that sadly, are in very short supply in today's cinema. Particularly with Bonham-Carter, one simply wishes that she would play more such roles. TRANSFER: At long last, yes! After a previously issued disc that frankly, wasn't worth the cheap piece of plastic it was recorded on, this new 2-disc version does right on all accounts. The picture is stunning in a new 16:9 anamorphic transfer. Colors are rich and well balanced. Contrast and shadow levels are bang on. There is some slight shimmering but nothing to terribly distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely represented. The music is the real kicker here. EXTRAS: Some interesting archival footage, a BBC featurette, a bit about the author and a very informative audio commentary. BOTTOM LINE: This is a keeper! This exquisite classic of Merchant-Ivory is sensually explores the struggle between the tight exterior of the British upper crust and the seething passion that lurks just beneath in the increasingly powerful middle class. You've seen a movie or two for sure that veer around such themes, but very few films have captured this combination of class struggle and personal liberation any more evocatively! Our protagonist is a young, passionate and repressed Miss Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter in possibly her best role ever) who exemplifies this unspoken inner-outer conflict. As she struggles between what is expected of her, to marry the effete and obnoxious Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day Lewis in a richly textured performance), and what she really wants, to be with the yearning, romantic George Emerson (a soft and unfocused Julian Sands) Miss Honeychurch must juggle class concerns and personal desires. As with any Merchant Ivory product, the all-round cast is vivid and intriguing. Maggie Smith never leaves a dull moment in any of her movies, a credo she maintains here as well as Lucy's nervous and confused escort -- for which she received a well deserved Oscar. As George's bewildered and sweet father, the marvellous Denholm Elliot steals every scene in which he appears. Lastly, Simon Callow as the ebullient, robust Reverend Beebe captures all that is good and true about humanity. A word for the DVD. The cinematography in this movie sparkles, and the DVD does complete justice to Ivory's camera skills -- the shots are so pure you will want to taste the dew resting atop the grass in the sumptuous English gardens. What a complete movie, full of life, love and hope! Highly recommended for your collections, you'll watch this more than once. """"A Room With A View"""" is a movie considered by many people as one of the best films ever made. So I decided to take a look to the movie, and even though I enjoyed """"A Room With A View"""", and every minute gets more and more interesting, I really don't think that this movie can compare with """"The Godfather"""", """"Casablanca"""" or """"Ben-Hur"""" as one of the best movies of all time. Anyway, the movie does have a lot of highlights: the cast is very good, the movie displays performances from nice actors, such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Maggie Smith and Helena Bonham Carter. The direction of James Ivory is outstanding, the photography, the set design, well everything is carefully designed. If you like period films, you will love """"A Room With A View"""". If you want to see why this movie is so beloved, go ahead, watch it, you might love it. I don't think """"A Room With A View"""" is a masterpiece, but you will at least enjoy this film, that's for sure. I cannot add much to those who have opined below except to state that I have probably watched this movie at least 100 times, know the dialogue by heart, and am nowhere near weary of it yet. I am going to Italy in October and cannot wait to see it; if it is anywhere near as stunning as it is in the movie, my airfare will be well worth it. I would"""

Has not aged well, not at all. It always sucked though let's be honest. ok great This is probably one of the best performances I have seen by Tom Cruise. He portrays Jerry McGuire, a sought after sports agent, that gets a wake up call causing him to reevaluates his priorities in life. Renee Zellweger is cast as his partner and wife. She is delightful and always a joy to watch. Cuba Gooding Jr. commands attention in every scene he is in. He was very impressive in this film. Who couldn't be in love with little Jonathan Lipnicki! Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise didn't blow me away like everyone else. Yes there are some remarkable performances such as Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Renee Zellweger (in her breakthrough role) but the plot is so in your face and contrived. Cameron Crowe's films tend to disappoint even though fans and critics adore him. Zellweger's funny and touching performance as lonely single mom, Dorothy is the main reason to watch this film, I remember watching her performance and thinking - she is going to be a huge star back in 1996, she is such a natural. Cruise isn't too shabby either but his character is so smug, it's hard to believe this guy actually has a good heart underneath. Love it or hate it, Jerry Maguire is over-rated. Good movie! Rent it first because it may not be a movie you want in your collection but I like the way these too work together. Great combination-comedy and drama. A successful sports manager turns idealistic and loses his job but is given a shortcut to love to fulfilment. One of Tom Cruise's better movies; with Cuba Gooding Jnr as the footballer who makes good. Rent it ! It is a great movie , just not in my list of must buy, defiantly a must see One of my absolute favorite Tom Cruise movies, I watch this over again and again. Love love love it! Why? It is REAL! The character relationships and interaction are HONEST. We are talking real, raw, genuine emotion! The movie is about making a change in your own character and living with the consequences, good and bad. It is about developing genuine relationships in your life. It is about two men who """"mature"""" through their relationship with each other. Some of the dialogue is now part of our pop-culture. There are some scenes that are hilarious. You will definitely take away a few things from this movie that will be with you forever. Hey, we all know JERRY MAGUIRE was a box office hit that put sultry Renee Zellweger on the superstar map and birthed one of the most famous lines in all of cinema. I've seen this little gem upteen times, enjoyed it even more with each viewing, and scratch my itchy head in amazement that I have yet to review it. Suffice it to say the review begins now. . . Let's bypass the plot and the Big Three (Renee, Tom, Cuba); for me this movie ultimately succeeds by the fantastic performances of several of its second tier players. Jay Mohr is the guy you love to hate as Jerry's backstabbing former boss, Bob Sugar; Bonnie Hunt is the manhater with a heart of pure gold as Renee's sis Laurel. But Regina King tops them all as Marcee, loving and devoted wife of unappreciated and underpaid Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell. King is a vivacious, voluptuous goddess who absolutely steals every scene she's in, and while she steals it she exudes steamy sensuality. Rod Tidwell is one lucky dude. So with the strength of its cast and its delightful plot, JERRY MAGUIRE has something for everyone. The Tom and Renee romance pleases the chicks, while the guys get off on the sports drama. Furthermore, sports enthusiasts will thoroughly enjoy all the cameos made by sports celebrities and broadcasters. Bottom line: If you haven't seen JERRY MAGUIRE, by all means see JERRY MAGUIRE.

And I'm glad that I wasn't the only person who thought that the kid was annoying! The movie became a slow and sappy chick flick instead of being the strong and fresh sports film that I had anticipated on seeing! But I have to say, Cuba's got the hottest body ever featured on film!...Lord have mercy! I bought this for no other reason, except I heard the the late-Glenn Frey has a very small part in this movie. It did turn out to be a great movie however. It's not a masterpiece but it is a very good film not so much for the meaning it may contain but for the images it sends in the audience. First it gives a positive image of sports by showing how one man, one agent can be different from all others in this """"industry"""", and that the main difference is to believe in what he is doing, to believe in what his heart is telling him, to work with his heart and to love the players, the athletes he is working for, he is working with. That emotional, personal and very close relationship is what everyone needs all the time to feel needed, supported. The film shows that this is also the winning method because athletes want that contact and they can recognize that human attitude and they will work for this warmth of the heart, from the heart and in the heart. And what's more this relationship will enable the athletes as well as the agents to face the difficulties life is made of and life brings up all the time. This will mean success to the athletes as athletes and success for both the agents and the athletes financially. What's more the film conveys another tremendously positive image because the agent is white and the athlete is black and their relationship is one of trust, total friendship and confidence, one of love nothing but love and care and that is the right model to send in the public: what is important is not the differences among people but the possibility to establish trusting and loving relationships beyond these differences and accepting them totally. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines Good movie - Kind of a classic. Arrived in good shape. I always have been a big fan of Tom Cruise and this movie was one of his finest performances. Renee Zelwegger also remarkable. It was a kind of movie that you could see over and over again. It's a must see Great inspirational movie. GREAT At the 1997 Academy Awards, host Billy Crystal referred to the characters played by the five Best Actor nominees (of which Tom Cruise was one) as being """"a burned guy, a mentally-challenged guy, a mentally-abused guy, a paralyzed guy, and an agent. And four out of the five are treatable."""" Of course Crystal was jokingly referring to the Agent as being beyond help. Among the figures of sports and entertainment, agents are often regarded as the necessary evil of the industry often with reputations as being the sleaziest of VIP's, just-above used car salesmen. Their antics which require a high-level of tough negotiations are sometimes seen as money-gouging and materialistic. In the film """"Jerry Maguire"""", Tom Cruise decides to wear the shoes of a sports agent and walk around in them for just over two hours. """"Who am I, and what am I doing?"""" Jerry Maguire asks when he realizes his sports agency, SMI, tries to cover up the darker aspects of professional sports. His answer is inspiring, transcendent, and detrimental. He mistakenly writes down his inspired thoughts and submits them to his colleagues for suggesting the agency concentrate better on fewer clients. For his inspiration, he loses his place at his agency and many of his highest-paying clients to his rival Bob Sugar. Subsequently, he also loses his attractive but shallow fianc. Maguire is forced to try and live his dream of being more caring and receptive towards the needs of his clients rather than just being there to get a slice of his athlete/clients' multi-million-dollar paychecks. In a particularly poignant sequence, he retains his client Frank """"Cush"""" Cushman who is a leading contender in the NFL draft through a handshake with his father, played by Beau Bridges. However, on draft day, he learns through an unexpected phone call that his rival Bob Sugar, through deception, convinced Cushman to sign with him instead. Now, Maguire has retained only Tidwell, and he must create his new agency from the ground up with only a single client as his starting point. So the question asked of the movie is: Can a sports agent find a more meaningful, possibly spiritual, life and still acquire the high-paying clientle? And maybe even more to the point, can an agent make a difference beyond just being a high-powered money negotiator? """"Jerry Maguire"""" is a thoroughly entertaining riches-to-rags-to-transcendence story of a fantasy sports agent trying to find a deeper purpose to an otherwise materialistic existence. The film works at almost all levels, particularly because of the dynamism of Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Academy Award-winning performance, playing the only client willing to stay with Maguire. Part of the story is Maguire's journey from the purely material to a deeper and more-satisfying existence. Rod Tidwell (Gooding), wide receiver for the Cardinals, is a strange opposite to Cruise but has a similar problem. Tidwell is a devoted father and husband, emotionally involved with his family but does not quite give that same heart on the football field. The story becomes about both characters finding something deeper in their place in the world, Gooding giving what he gives to his family to his team, and Cruise giving to his clients and co-worker/lover Dorothy Boyd his love and attention. Renee Zellweger plays Dorothy Boyd in a passionate and sensitive performance that will definitely bring tears. Zellweger's son becomes an important character and also an inspiration to Cruise to find the deeper and more sensitive part of himself. In the materialistic world of late 20th-century America, """"Jerry Maguire"""" is a breath of fresh air. A rare story produced by the money-obsessed film studios about the dangers of losing oneself for the sake of self-promotion and monetary gain. An interesting statistic has emerged of late regarding a high number of American businessmen on their deathbeds who begin regretting the direction and purpose of their lives. """"Jerry Maguire"""" offers an alternative, although probably few in his position would find the wisdom to change course. But since you can't take it with you, life is about what you leave behind. Awesome movie!! Great! Wonderful purchase! Another good Cruise film This was a huge hit in 1996; I thought it was terrible. Admittedly, I was in the minority. My roommate loved it so I was forced to sit through this cliched, sappy , politically correct movie. (Sorry, Doug, but it was awful). There were repeated lame lines from Renee Zellweger, Cruise's love interest, like this gem: """"You had me at hello,"""" """"I love him for the man he could be, etc."""" The only good friend of Cruise was a black guy (Cuba Gooding Jr.) A lot of talented actors in the movie, sadly their talents were wasted. The good thing: At least there was no sequel. Came in a timely manner, works as expected and continues to function as promised A wonderful movie. Funny and charming at times. It was one of my favorite VHS movies and am so glad to now have it in DVD format. Thank You... Cameron Crowe hit a homer with this one. A very enjoyable film with stellar performances by all.

He has hired full time housekeepers to provide that care when he isn't around. However  he has exhausted the list of housekeepers  who keep quitting because Joon is too much to handle. As such  Benny makes the decision that perhaps it would be best for all concerned if Joon were to live in a group home  something he is hesitating telling her for fear of her reaction. Into their lives comes Sam  the eccentric cousin of Benny's friend Mike  Sam who they obtained from Mike in a losing hand of poker. Among his eccentricities  Sam has a penchant for bursting into Buster Keatonesque physical comedy routines.

Deep did a great job and I loved it. He is a great actor. Somewhat tedious. very good movies and great stars worth the watch Not what I expected A really sweet 90's style romantic dramedy. Loved it! liked the move totally weird. Even though I gave it 3 stars it is still enjoyable to watch. Have watched it over and over and over and over... Great Move we loved it! Awesome movie! Big fan of Johnny Drpp and also Adrain and Mary! Very cute story! Good movie. Johnny depp is great. This was a lighthearted humorous love story between two quirky but endearing individuals. It does deal with real issues of mental illness and the medical system that cares for them but not in a serious way. The movie was well acted and shows off the considerable talents of Johnny Depp. good movie A fun and funny good time movie. An enjoyable movie. A lovely little movie about all kinds of love. A young Johnny Depp does a full repertoire of silent film scenes from Harpo Marx, WC Fields, Chaplain, et al as well as inventing new methods of cooking, house cleaning, and breaking into a mental hospital. Quirky and quietly fun. Not for me. The cast did a great job in this movie. The story showed to me that we should never underestimate love even when it comes to those of us who are a little mental or different. A tale for heart and mind Benny & Joon is a movie about a car mechanic who lives with his mentally ill sister. Well, she's not THAT ill - but ill enough that Benny has to take care of her, and this even at the cost of not developing a life on his own. One day, a weirdo - played brilliantly by annoyingly good-looking Johnny Depp - comes to town. This is the start of changes in the life of Joon. And of Benny. This unusual movie has all a good movie needs. It is an interesting, moving and also entertaining story, told in a heartfelt way without being too sentimental. And fortunately it lacks the major drawbacks of Hollywood movie clich&eacute;s! Fun Reese Witherspoon was surprisingly good in The Man in the Moon. She was just starting out as an actress in this movie. Benny & Joon is a classic. Both of these movies are good. Benny & Joon and The Man in the Moon are both amazing films. Both are very heartwarming and touching. Great deal to get both in the same package. I would definitely recommend both of these movies to everyone. Though I am generally not a fan of these pre-packaged double features because you often end up with one film you want and one you are just ho-hum about, this one has two really enjoyable films which, while quite different, are very appealing. Benny and Joon has sort of taken on cult status as a quirky romantic comedy since its original release. Johnny Depp gives a charismatic performance as the very off-beat Sam, who watches Benny's (AIdan Quinn) sister, Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) while he works. The focus is on the romance that develops between Sam and Joon, but Aidan Quinn is excellent also as a brother so worried about his mentally challenged sister's future he almost harpoons his own chance at happiness with a young and lovely Julianne Moore. The grill cheese scene, the hat in the park, and the poignant bus scene offer both romance and just enough depth to make this film live whereas others in the genre simply fall flat. Masterson is just as memorable as Depp in her own way and the secondary romance offers something of interest as well. A great date movie. As good as """"Benny and Joon"""" is, however, the real prize here might just be """"Man in the Moon."""" A poignant coming of age story set in rural Louisiana during the 1950's, it is beautifully photographed and filled with love and tenderness. The focal point of director Robert Mulligan's fine film is a very young Reese Witherspoon and she truly sparkles. Sam Waterson is the kind and gentle husband and father whose two daughters are growing up faster than he can blink while one more is on the way. Tess Harper has another fine turn as his loving wife Abigail. There is a very human and peaceful feel to this film that works its way into your heart slowly and remains there long after the closing credits. Dani (Reese Witherspoon) is the spunky but tender-hearted 14 year old younger sister who is beginning to cross the waters from child to young womanhood. Her adolescent crush on Elvis Presley changes to something real when 17 year old Court Foster (Jason London) enters the picture. They both like to swim in the lake and become something more than friends but something less than a couple. Their relationship is handled in a sweet and thoughtful manner by Mulligan, who also helmed """"Summer of '42."""" But as much as Court cares about her when chance brings he and her older sister Maureen (Emily Wakefield) together nature takes its course and someone's heart is bound to break. Dani secretly worships Maureen and wants to be like her and Maureen loves Dani just as much but can't pass up the love of her life no matter how hard she might try. Court is also portrayed as a very decent kid with the weight of the world on his shoulders who is trying to do the right thing and still be happy. Everthing about this feels real, as there are no good guys and bad guys, just a truthful portrait of young love and growing up. Witherspoon is amazing and you can truly feel her heart breaking as she begins to disappear, only her memories of the lake and her first kiss to comfort her. It will take even more than a tragedy to bring Dani and Maureen back together and it is the wise and gentle father who takes Dani fishing and talks to her in a way every father hopes he will talk to his daughter under similar circumstances. A quiet and wonderful film handled with great sensitivity, it is quite memorable. Put together with """"Benny and Joon"""" it is hard to pass up, and hopefully will be more widely seen. A real bargain. Here I got a 2 for one deal. My favorite!! I liked man in the moon, it is a good drama. You need a box of kleenex though. i found it to be a tear jerker at some point. Now Benny and Joon. I don't know how anyone can not fall in love with Johnny Depp. Yes, he was great in Pirate's of the Caribbean. He plays a slightly different character in this film, he is a bit autistic one might say? He plays his character to the fullest. He is charming, witty, just so adorable. It's a classic but it will never be too old for any genre. This movie is like a breath of fresh air! Don't take my word for it, do a search for Benny and Joon movie trailer, watch the preview and then you just might see where I'm coming from. (my fav. part is him doing hat tricks) no comment i've always loved this movie!!!! This is one of Johnny's funnier moments of creative acting. He's an A list actor and never lets you down when doing a piece such as Benny and Joon. I love anything Johnny is in, he's is one of my favorite actors. Probably his resemblance to me Haha (not kidding) We had not even heard of this movie until recently. We have purchased it for ourselves and a copy for each of our adult children. It is a funny and heartwarming movie for all. We really enjoyed it. I started watching this movie but didn't find it interesting so stopped watching after about 5 minutes so I really cant comment beyond this. Really good movie with real """"characters"""" No one can do strange like Johnny Depp! I enjoyed this feel good movie a lot. too somber of a flick for me...but johnny depp is fantastic as usual of course. i had a hard time keeping my attention. fun story- yet sad too- it is a good story about a look into mental illness and just who is really the crazy one A funny and touching story about family devotion and mental illness and a love story, too. Johnny Depp does Charlie Chaplin routines with great aplomb. The entire cast is great : Johnny Depp, Mary Stuart Masterson, Julianne Moore, Aiden Quinn, Oliver Platt, William H. Macy... what else do you need for a great movie? The acting guild did a brilliant job of putting these actors together. They played their parts expertly and naturally. Dealing with mental disabilities is possible. I have recommended this movie to many friends and family. I love this movie, it's fantastic, I've watched it so many times I've lost count. I saw this movie when I was about 8 & even at that age I loved this film. Johnny Depp does a phenomenal job, as do all of the other actors. It's a very unique storyline & holds your attention all the way through; it has just enough emotion with the perfect amount of comedy. The DVD: Works great, no issues there. There are no exciting special features, but I wasn't looking for that, so I personally didn't care. Overall: This is a must see, it really is! The performaces alone make at least one viewing worth your while. This is early Johnny Depp, with Depp at his most daring best. The plot is a bit far-fetched at times, but the acting is always superior. A great DVD to wind down a turbulent week at work. In a sense, a tribute to those of difference who make a difference--not necessarily for others but for themselves--in their own world of mentally and psychologically challenging experiences. Ah, to watch a young and lovely Depp in action, his talent is amazing. There were other actors in the film, too, they were good... I choose this rating cuz well I loved this movie it was funny, the movie never messed up on amazon and was great. I recommend this movie to everyone. I Love this movie over and over again. Great movie with a young Johnny Depp. Loved it! Acting was good, but story was only mildly entertaining. Top stars when they all were starting in films. Shows why the became great. Story is quirky, but it well directed. It is a good movie well worth the time I would recommend it. Great movie from beginning to end. Enjoyed it Absolutely delightful movie! I have watched this movie a """"thousand"""" times because of the tender lines of the mentally challenged scenes. Depp and Masterson were superb! My favorite scene was """"faith in me"""" delicious love scene. Words weren't spoken. The entire scene was by music, movement and glances. My heart melts every time single time. A love portrayed that pure is a wondrous sight! Quirky tale that could have been better. It's the story of 2 misfits who fall in love and struggle to be together against all odds. Unfortunately it's predictable. both Ms Masterson and Mr Depp seem uncomfortable in their roles. Entertaining and funny. Worth a watch on a lazy weekend. If you're a Johnny Depp fan this is a must have WONDERFUL, FUNNY, MOVING! Johnny Depp is awesome in this movie and I consider it a hidden gem in his career! This is very entertaining. Another Johnny Dep movie. Always a good bet. 20TH TIME , GREAT good was a present only watched because had to for school assignment Charming, sensitive portrayal of outside the ordinary people who find a way to live happily as themselves. The movie gives hope to those who have friends or family"""	Benny Joon

There are three highly rated films in this box and if you like at least 2 of the 3, you have a very good value here. For me,the outstanding film was Donnie Brasco which had terrific performances by Pacino and Depp. The comments by Joe Pistone (whose story is being told in the movie) about how the movie and reality differed (in small ways only) was quite interesting. For Bugsy,I wish the movie had covered more of his early life (his rise) and cut back on some of the later material (less of Jack Dragna and Hollywood). Snatch was a bit difficult to get a grip on with its close mix of comedy and crime. In this it bears a close resemblance to Cotton Comes to Harlem.

Wonderful movie that looked into the complexities and layers of 1 African American families problems and as a family how they dealt with those problems Love the movie A longtime favorite of mine. Really good movie Loved it!! This is a movie that I have on a DVD, and it's a good movie. It's one of the greatest family movies I've ever seen, and it's about family getting together and having Sunday dinners. This movie """"Soul Fooi"""" is also a movie that reminds me of times like Thanksgiving, and I would watch this movie on the day of Thanksgiving. I find this is movie """"Soul Food"""" is also similar to the 2007 Christmas movie """"This Christmas"""", and I do have that movie on a DVD as well. There's one actor in this movie that's also in that 2007 Christmas movie, and it's Mekhi Phifer. Just like in this movie """"Soul Food"""", I find he played a good role. So after watching this movie """"Soul Food"""", I would then watch the movie """"This Christmas"""" that I find similar to this movie, and with Mekhi Phifer who was one of the main characters that also played in this movie. A great crafted story great Great movie!!! I owned this on VHS and had to purchase it on Dvd as well. The thing that first attracted me to this movie was it cast some of my favorites like Vivica Fox, Nia Long, Mekhi Phifer, and Vanessa Williams. It became one of my all-time favorites the very first time that I watched it; I loved the storylines because it chronicled all of the issues of a regular family; reminded me of my very own family. Great movie with funny moments as well as several heart wrenching ones as well. No doubt, this is a awesome movie and the series. Family favorite Super Touches home to every urban family wonderful Great!!! Real lifetime movie I love the the Dvd movie Soulfood it reminds me of my family and the Sunday dinner's and my Big Moma house. Truly enjoyed seeing this again. Great family movie. Great cast. Great storyline. Love this movie This movies has a blend of comedy and drama, just like real life. Great writing and Superior ensemble cast. Very well done. I highly recommend this film. A classic and I wanted it to add to my collection, It was great quality for the price. After all the hype, I was totally bored and lost interest. I loved to watch Soul food movie TV so good and sad Got this free. Probably never watch it but hey free is free. love it thanks the stars are my review I couldn't get it to run smoothly. It kept on stopping. Such a good movie. The importance of forgiveness and family This is how families used to be with the troubles and all we stuck together and this movie gives me that. movie soul food is a classic if you don't have it in your collection you must get it is absolutely wonderful I saw this movie years ago and decided to add it to my collection. It is a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy. I have cerebral palsy, and for the last few months I have had my first African American aide. He laughs at me because nearly all of the films in my collecttion are dark, violent, and depressing. So, he made me watch """"Soul Food"""" and the best part of the movie is the insight it brought to me with regard to his cooking. (I have hardly been to a restaurant since his arrival.) I know nothing about cooking, and that is probably a good thing because he says he wouldn't share his his """"secrets"""" anyway. Though I HAVE noticed that he has NEVER, EVER used a measuring cup. (something that is reflected in this film.) Also, before he came I avoided green beans like the plague. (I'm sure many a Black person has knowingly mocked the rubbery, limp, God-awful things we White people call green beans. White children drench these abominations in ketchup and even then have to be forced to eat them a gunpoint...) However, there is a scene in """"Soul Food"""" in which a child excitedly recites the menu that includes green beans with his smile intact, and there is not a ketchup bottle in sight. (I now have """"string beans"""" with every meal.) I feel free to include these things in a review because it seesms to me that """"Soul Food"""" is largely true to it's title, the movie is ABOUT THE FOOD and it's apparently unifying power, it's also about the kind of food we deprived and deathly bland White Northern dwellers have been missing. (My aide has informed me that a select group of White Southerners have been made honorary initiates into the art.) So, if there are any people out there who have stumbled upon a sampling of Soul Food and are wondering how it's done, this movie will give you a precious glimpse..... This is such a good family movie! It has all the trials and tribulations that people go thru and how they can over come them if they work at it. The movie has a lot of good actors in it that really brought it together, this really is one of my fav. movies of all time. It made me wish that I had a family so close as they did, getting together to have dinners. Not just on holidays but every Sunday. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to change the """"bad"""" things in your life. I wish my whole family,aunts,uncles,cousins,yada,yada,yada,would do that on Sundays,even if my grandparents are dead. Big Mama's brother was alive,and he didn't like McDonalds[Everyone loves McDonalds!] He loved only homecooked soul food. I saw this in my class on semester with Nobody's Fool,Home For The Holidays,The Joy Luck Club,Soul Food,Bastard Out Of Carolina,and The Burning Bed. Big Mama didn't want to have her leg or arm amputated,so it killed her. This movie was so poetic and to the heart talking about how family sticks together through the ups and downs. The movie had me in tears and I loved the togetherness of family during Sunday dinner. But the overall matter of the movie is family will press on no matter how hard and tough it seems, family sticks together. THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE ABOUT FAMILY. THIS MOVIE ABOUT A FAMILY STRUGGLING TRONG TO GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER AND TOGETHERNESS, LOVING EACH OTHER, AND BEING THERE FOR ONE ANOTHER IN HARD TIMES BUT THE FAMILY STICKS TOGETHER AND STAYS TOGETHER AND OVERCOME THEIR FAMILY PROBLEMS. I watched Soul Food expecting a powerful film about a black family coming together in a time of crisis. I got that and a lot more. We watch the story unfold from the perspective of a twelve-year-old boy. From his eyes we see the stories of the Matriarch and her three daughter's families. When Big Momma dies, Chaos threatens to destroy the family as each of the three daughters become more selfish in dealing with their own personal problems. The twelve year old spends the rest of the film trying to bring his crumbling extended family back together. The production values were amazing for a $6 million dollar movie, I felt like I was watching a $50 million film. The cinematographer and director do a great job; I felt like I was on those Chicago streets along with the family. All of the actors here give great performances, Vanessa Williams, is unforgettable as Bird. Viveca Fox shows range in her role as the middle daughter and Nia Long is great as the baby of the family. On the men's side Michael Beach gives another strong performance. Beach should be a bigger star than he is; he gave some great performances in the 90's. Other noteworthy performances include the actress who played Big Momma and the twelve year old who the story revolves around. This movie is wonderful. Anyone who collects DVDs must have this film in their collection. It was 100% real. I love every scene and every character. I am glad this movie was made. This movie says it all, drama, feel good comedy and all star cast, it has the essence of a fantastic movie. The story is strong, heartbreaking and facinating, the comedy is mild and humerous and i just loved the cast. If you are a fan of African American movie, this is what you should've watched inthe first place. If it was in the Top 50 Africn American movies, it would come"""	Soul Food

I'm one of those people who expects a movie billed as a """"romantic comedy"""" to have an upbeat ending. This movie did not. I hated it. It was a rotten ending to an already bad day. So, unless you don't mind an otherwise funny movie going downhill fast and ending in a crumpled heap....don't bother. some how, even though its supposedly a brand new disc, it skips in certain sections of the special features. This is kind of aggravating. But the movie itself is good terrible! i was very happy with my purchase thank you. A classic you HAVE to watch! I watched this for sentimental reasons, I was in middle school when it came out - and it touched on a lot of subjects that were eye opening to me at the time. Twenty years on - it seems really dated. Ben Affleck's character is so much more of a jerk than I remember, to the degree that I don't even feel like you could make this movie in this day and age and be relevant. It was a nice trip down memory lane, and perhaps a nice reminder of how far gender and LGBT rights have come. i gifted it, never saw it Boring don't waste your time. Just OK. On time. Dvd was grainy Should be watched by anyone , perusing, an open relationship . ***SPOILERS FOLLOW AS TO THEMES BUT NOT THE ENDING*** A close look at the double-standard, and the fact that people fall in love and ultimately choose Mr. or Ms. Right for reasons that have less to do with sex or sexual prowess and more to do with...other things. Or, maybe, to put it another way, LOVE is the best aphrodisiac. I thought Adams, Affleck, Lee and Ewell (Hooper) were all very good, charismatic, with potent chemistry between them. I don't mind profanity in itself (if you do, there's lots of it, every obscenity imaginable). What I did mind was the GRATUITOUS sexual banter, found the scene wherein Adams and Lee swap stories at the top of their lungs, with great hilarity, of their many minge-munching mishaps, LUDICROUS- a thoroughly unnatural, unlikely scene (and we're to believe that reserved, circumspect Affleck would find such crude and indiscreet braggadocio entertaining and appealing? I think not). People don't tend to talk this way with members of the opposite sex, whatever their sexual orientation, for one thing, and certainly not with people they've just met. I fault Kevin Smith, of course, for this juvenile, """"let's be smutty and outrageous so that people who don't like soppy """"chick flicks"""" won't mind so much that we're tackling sensitive relationship issues"""" approach. The movie would've been better without it, imo. I had mixed feelings about the somewhat abusive relationship between the two stoners (are there grown men who actually talk to each other this way? If so, they're in dire need of some relationship counseling), AND, the one's cautionary tale about chasing Amy. That theme (albeit arguably profound) could've been delivered much more subtly, shown not told, in a way that produced an """"A-hah!"""" reaction in viewers- how much more powerful an experience that would've been, and combined with eliminating the smut for smut's sake, could have elevated the film to greatness. There were lots of sharp glints of truth, e.g., the """"bi-phobic"""" cold shoulder Alyssa gets from her lesbian friends when they learn she's involved with a man- so true, many lesbians are known for treating bisexual women like lepers, """"dabblers""""- suspecting that bi women are either denying their true heterosexuality or their true homosexuality and just plain CONFUSED (shades of what lesbians themselves suffer). When WILL people stop thinking in such narrow, either-or, US versus THEM terms? This could be a tag line for the entire film, come to think of it. The close, long-term relationship between Banky and Holden was interesting too and bespoke of love, of need. That door was cracked but not opened, we never learn if Banky is indeed """"gay"""" (perhaps not). The film raises lots of intriguing issues re: sex, gender, sexual orientation, friendship and love, much food for thought, though doesn't explore them in great depth. But hey, along with its other themes, it was audacious, innovative, groundbreaking. KUDOS to Smith for that. The core of the film though, and what I like best, is struggling mightily to relate to another honestly, heart to heart- without letting convention, delusions, fears, sex roles, previous experiences, others' opinions or anything else interfere- no easy task- all embodied in Ben Affleck's nuanced performance (likewise, I found him the REAL deal, the touchstone (along with Ginnifer Goodwin) of Ken Kwapis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/He-s-Just-Not-That-Into-You/dp/B0024DF9MU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">He's Just Not That Into You</a>, by virtue of his very presence, his sincerity and quiet dignity- like Gary Cooper or Henry Fonda, lending credibility to whatever he's in- always impeccable). RECOMMENDED. Still good. Not great, but it has some solid moments that you can only get through this movie. awesome Huge Kevin Smith fan. Loved this movie! A Fun Original film that will have you on the floor laughing. What a huge waste of time. Terrible movie with terrible acting. Completely unbelievable story. I don't remember For whatever reason, did not like this movie. I know it's a 'classic' but I just was not feeling it. Love Kevin Smith...just not Chasing Amy. I enjoyed Dogma when I was a pretentious college student, but aside from Red State, I find all of Kevin Smith's films annoying, sexist, racist, and self-impressed attempts at being smarter than pop culture. Unfortunately, they aren't very smart, and they perpetuate the same old cliches he's trying to make fun of, making them even more annoying than what he's trying to satirize. This one is among the worst. It's a stereotypical romantic comedy with a bit of sadly awkward quirkiness mixed in. I guess the fact that """"Amy"""" is a lesbian is supposed to be ground breaking, but it only renders the main character that much more pathetic in his obsession with her. After watching this film, I'm embarrassed for the main character, the writer, and the producer, that any of them thought he was a likable guy or that his pathetic, adolescent problems would appeal to a thinking adult audience. I didn't even finish watching the movie because it was draggy. Why can't you put out some Christian and Biblical movies without having to rent them? It seems like there are very few movies on Instant Prime Video that are that good that is free to watch to Prime Members. If I am going to pay to be a Prime member, you would think there would be more good movies and more variety of movies that is free to watch. Ben Afleck's perfect girl turns out not to be what she seems to him, and therein lies the tale. What happens next when her past is revealed.......? It was entertaining, though a bit too risqu at times when my kids happened to walk through the room. Affleck was ok - not his best work. Adams was pretty good. Jay and (not so) Silent Bob were excellent. Jason Lee sorta made the movie, for me. The courtship and romance was cute, but I had trouble believing Affleck's character's reaction to certain events. Overall, not a bad movie, but just average. Was probably forward looking when made. It seems very dated now. The plot is weak and performances are not very convincing. Didn't like the vulgar language right off the bat and every other word. Hard to see Ben like that too I thought it was a bit crude, but that's just me. Good acting by all. Didn't care for the ending at all. I guess the movie was okay, I liked the actors, but didn't care for the theme. Not my type of movie. I thought the characters were very sad and the story without much to commend it. I would not recommend this movie. The film feels very dated. It seems like a product of the times dealing with gay and lesbian acceptance issues. The story didn't hang together or make much sense to me. I am surprised Affleck would be in such a film. good charactors, complex performances, uncomfortable story line and a touching resolution... what can I say da, it's a mixed review I think this movie's biggest problem is that it's set in the ViewEskiewniverse. It's another part in the story of they Jersey(ish) crew that ties in with the likes of Clerks, Mallrats, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, etc. But it's not like those movies. There's a small bit of the random quirky funniness there, but it's too serious and there's too much badly acted drama. I don't know if it's the cast that makes this one a stinker, or the characters, or maybe Smith just wasn't quite ready for this film? It's hard to say. Chasing Amy is not exactly a heartwarming tale but it's a realistic one. It follows the story of a man named Holden McNeil as he enters a relationship with a woman named Alyssa who self identifies as a lesbian. Through the course of the film their relationship develops and he suffers through bouts of unrequited love that begins to take a toll on their ever growing relationship. Eventually, it comes to a head when the emotional attachment he feels can no longer go without being dealt with and things start to get pretty complex from there. I'm sure most of the reviews have already spoiled the film but there's a lot of layers to the conflicts present and despite the immature dialogue that peppers the script there is a wealth of mature themes that underlie the entire film. If you've ever been in love, you can understand the one scene where there is a heart wrenching profession of it and if you've ever felt like you've been out of your league then you'll understand when the film deals with those emotions in an honest and true way, as well. Holden McNeil feels real as a character and though his reactions might seem unrealistic to some, I've seen it played out a million times in a million different ways. Certainly one of Kevin Smith's finest moment. It was great it was to my satisfaction it was a speedy delivery and I like the movie Horrifically lousy movie. Don't waste your money. Great for back story! Caught a few moments of this on Indie the other day. Can't now for the life of me think of why I thought it so imPOrTanT and influENtial back in the 90s. What a load of gender bending programming and Progressive Agenda crap it is. The lines are so forced. The postures so contrived. And even back then AFFleck was so AFFected and full of himself. It's BS like this that has made so many fresh gullible young minds so confused. Looking back, I always hated the message of this piece of propaganda but couldn't exactly articulate why. Now I know. It's because this movie is just nothing more than someone's ideologically and morally depraved agenda. Some Weinstein telling us what to think while they abuse us behind our backs and laugh at how stupid we are. It doesn't actually have anything to observe or contribute to life. It's ugly, vulgar and toxic. Watch it if you must but don't try to pretend this is great art. It's not. As art it totally sux. What it is, is a great con. This is the most disgusting and offensive movie that I have ever seen. This is as disgusting as you can get without seeing any nudity or any actual sex. From the moment that Holden meets Alyssa, she is cursing and getting drunk and talking graphically about lesbian sex and making out with a woman right in front of him. Yet, somehow, Holden is shocked to find out about her """"past"""" - - that she had all kinds of disgusting sex"""	Chasing Amy

Interesting look at the 1970's porn business. Big name stars delivering fantastic performances. Wahlberg, Reynolds, Moore, Reilly, Graham, Cheadle, Macy) Director Paul Thomas Anderson is the symbolic heir to Robert Altman. His multi-character extravaganzas of social observation obviously owe much to Altman's influence. (And, he was Altman's assistant on PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION, his final film.) This is Anderson's first, big, carnival type foray into Altman territory, after HARD EIGHT , his more modest, but worthwhile, debut. It is a brightly colored, multi-layered extravaganza about the world of 1970s pornography, liberated as never before and wildly successful in seedy run down former neighborhood theatres. This all was altered when videotape raised it head and changed everything. The production vales of a commercial film, even the 'grade z-level' went out the window with tape, and this film tacks about that transition. It's like the talkie revolution taking over from the silent era, only in a smaller, seedier milieu. It lovingly paints a picture of so-called filmmakers, living the good life from the huge profits from their little epics, facing real disaster when any goofball with a camcorder can pull off a skin flick and market it for cheaps. Wonderfully acted by a great cast; Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Bill Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman all have career making (or restoring) parts in this. Very funny and quite moving. The blu ray is veery nice, a big improvement over the earlier dvd and laser version, all of which I've bought. The commentaries are awful though. One, apparently was the result of the cast watching the video in a party atmosphere and is just a bunch of drunken snippets of chitchat and telephone calls, and the other, not much better... just Anderson, alone, but incoherent But the film is aces. An interesting and scary movie. good movie When you see a PT Anderson film, you can smeel Cinema from every pore. This is his second film but it's like the very first masterpiece he made and the one that launched his career. It's a Scorsese style tale of an era and a way of life: sparkling and damned at the same time. Told like a breathtaling journey down to hell and back. The funeral of an era ending starting from the seventies and ending up in the plastic times of the eighties. Few directors could have done it better. Very good blu ray too Pleased Wonderful price and arrived EARLY! Thank You!! awesome It came as described. Fantastic! Loved my purchase! TRACKING SHOTS TO WRITE HOME ABOUT I can believe it took me soooo long to see it! Loved it! I really like this movie and the sound track is great great work in shipping and product care. Boogie Nights is another great film by Paul Thomas Anderson, capturing the soul and essence of a fading era and the dawning of a new age. Anderson makes complicated, multifaceted films. Boogie Nights is no exception, casting this transition is the lives of a group of people, in this case the 'adult entertainment' industry. With the waning years of the 1970s, an age of excess, melding into the 1980s, the me decade with a meaner streak, the film casts an penetrating eye on the lives of those who lived it, the winners and losers (and sometimes both). Mark Wahlberg turns in a boffo performance as Eddie Adams, aka Dirk Diggler who dreams of stardom and an escape from a dreary life in the seedier parts of LA. His dreams seem fulfilled when he's discovered by Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) an adult film director. Dirk ascends the ladder of success, only to fall, far, into drugs and despair. Highly recommended, especially to those who love complex, multi-layered films that offer more with repeated viewings. Very good movie Great item thank you Genius. great! Boogie Nights is a masterpiece ... and one of my top 10 favorite films. It's a great film experience, but like all PTA films it's challenging in one way or another. In this case, the subject matter, nudity or violence may bother some (although compared to present-day films people must be used it by now). It's not a classic Hollywood movie, and while multiple story lines are followed, it flows at a rapid pace. Anderson made great use of cinematography, editing and soundtrack (no wonder he was nominated for an Oscar for direction). The cast is amazing (Oscar nods there too), with many of today's A-listers in early roles. Having it on Blu-ray is great. The quality is there PTA claims it's the definitive version. I appreciated finally getting the extras ... especially lots of commentaries. The deleted scenes are worth the price alone, but I recall another scene of Todd, Scotty and Reed in the driveway from a previous DVD release and hoped to refresh my memory. great movie third had look at Jon Holmes life Awesome movie. Tons of great actors and actresses. Plenty of drugs, sex, and violence plus you get to see Heather Graham naked! I love this movie, just the feel, the time it takes place in. I watch it every 2, 3 or 4 years and it's always good. It's funny and ridiculous. So many great actors, too. I don't know about you but the topic alone made me watch this--again and again and again. Must see. Everyone in the cast was so perfect for their roles. A great movie with a great cast. Funny and thrilling. I love Paul Thomas Anderson's films! fun movie to watch with a lady friend :D What a movie! Goes in the all time classics bin. So accurate in its deception of the rising porn industry. Was such a fun watch; 27 times... Not quite the flix I remember, it really shows its age as do I. It was fun to see everybody when they were young, save for Julianne Moore who looks the same now as she did then. I don't know how the woman stays so young looking, but here's to her. By the way I saw her in """"Still Alice"""" She did a fine job of acting and I'm aware of the seriousness of the subject matter it covers, but the movie was boring and slow moving. You can take that comment with as many grains of salt as you care to. Excellent! adult movies and weiners. So basically pretty good flick, and roller girl is hot. And gets her kit out pretty early on. One of the greatest movies ever made! Now that its available in blu ray i love it even more !! I saw this movie years ago and had it on VHS and intended to buy the DVD eventually, but opted for the download instead. I remember seeing this when it came out. It was bold, different, and real. Watching it 10+ years later, I found it a really sad tale. It had been nearly 15 years since I first saw BOOGIE NIGHTS in the theatre. And Paul Thomas Anderson's storytelling & visuals were SO powerful that when I saw it again recently it was just as effective. The fact that I remembered so much of the visual images says something about his eye as a filmmaker. BOOGIE NIGHTS & MAGNOLIA are timeless classics. Great film, good soundtrack. Also has an awesome continuous camera panning shot in the beginning of the film. Very cool. Not the best or the worst Classic! None Simply one of the best. yeah! SMOOTH!!! Love the movie I didn't know Mark Wahlberg could be a good actor until I saw this movie. Sorry to his fans but this is the best he's ever gonna be in a movie. Amazing performances all around from the entire cast. Big fan of Paul Thomas Anderson and this is probably his best work. It feels so surreal the way they just switch from happy to depressing right when 1980 hits. Overall great movie and I recommend it to anyone except my parents. They've seen it and liked it but it's not something you watch on family movie night. From the opening shot til the mostly shocking last, Boogie Nights is an enormously entertaining and at times hilarious film. In only his second film, Paul Thomas Anderson proved that he is a force to be reckoned with. great Dirk's finest work. Great BD release of a modern classic! This movie is amazing. The rise and subsequent fall of a group of aquantences in the 70s/80s porn industry. This movie is every bit as good as Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, Forrest Gump or any other top rated movies of the past 30 years. genius film making. the cast is perfect Great Movie, Great Release. Dark comedy and good film excellent condition Prompt delivery. All as advertised. It was fun to see all the actors when they were much younger. This film has lots of violent action, profanity, and sex but also has a fun story and humor. Interesting show! Never could get enough of """"Roller Girl"""". also contains an early and great performance by the lat Philip Seymour Hoffman. Beautifully remastered classic As advertised. I recommend this seller. Like Ed Wood, Boogie Nights is one of the forgotten masterpieces of the 90s. James Cameron's Titanic came out the same year and grabbed up many of the big awards and while Camerons film is a fun guilty pleasure, Paul Thomas Andersons Boogie Nights wipes the floor with it. Titanic is an entertaining piece of popcorn escapism; Andersons film is one of the greatest films of the late twentieth century. Coming off the heels of his strong debut Hard Eight, twenty-seven year old Paul Thomas Anderson delivered one of the best American films of the 90s, a film that always holds up on repeated viewings and, if anything, has grown on me over the years. Theres something really magical about first-rate directors who are also first-rate writers; Billy Wilder, Francis Ford Coppola, Woody Allen, Quentin Tarantino, and the Coen brothers belong on that list and with Boogie Nights, Paul Thomas Anderson proved that he belongs on that list, as well. This screenplay (a reworked version of his earlier short film The Dirk Diggler Story) is filled with rich dialogue, fascinating situations, and some exemplary character development. In Boogie Nights, Anderson was miraculously able to assemble one of the best casts for any film ever made and effectively utilize everyones talents to the best of their abilities; top-notch actors like Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and William H. Macy do some of their finest work in this film and while Im not sure how it happened, Anderson was able to get a great performance from the truly never better Burt Reynolds. This film has Scorseses style, Altmans scope, and Tarantino's sense of structure. The influences are obvious, from the long opening shot that recalls the openings to Orson Welles Touch of Evil and Robert Altmans The Player and the films final shot, a homage to Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. Somehow, though, Andersons film never feels derivative; hes throwing a lot of his own ideas onto the screen and when hes borrowing, hes borrowing from the best. Many young filmmakers wear their inspirations on their sleeves until they find their own voice, but Andersons voice here is clear: he captures the culture of the 1970s with great, impeccable detail. Its not just that he get the music or the clothes right; its that he encapsulates the decades mood: a culture of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, no doubt, but also a world of post-Vietnam and Watergate disillusionment. Boogie Nights focuses on the pornography industry in the 1970s and 1980s, but it never feels like a period piece; many latter-day films about this era seem to give little winks and nods to the dated elements of the periods they take place in, and while that may be fun, there's an authenticity and focus to Boogie Nights that is rare. I'm sure there are"""	Boogie Nights

Great old movie with values Thus is a great movie. I recommend. Kind of slow moving. You can tell it's an older movie, since there's not quite as much action or drama as in modern movies. It's good. Great flick This movie stands the test of time. Harrison Ford, at his handsomest, does a great job as a gritty Philly cop falling in love with an Amish woman. Gorgeous images of Amish life interspersed with some tight thriller scenes. I always find the most powerful scene to be the one where Ford punches out a tourist who is harrassing the Amish men. It arouses in me such a conflicting set of emotions - I want to be on the side of their nonviolence, but deep down it makes me realize I also want to see the retribution. Movies that can make us think while also entertaining us -- priceless! Excellent movie. Harrison ford sure has improved his acting since then. The movie was good but compared to his acting in the last decade, he has much improved. That does not take away from this movie though. Kept me guessing. Very good Though it's hard to believe an Amish family would harber an English cop with a gun, this movie is a good window in to the culture with an interesting story line. Of course, it's Harrison Ford... Great movie to watch at any time of the day. Don't like the language but enjoyed the movie otherwise The best of acting, directing, messaging and imagery. Does not get better good script, wonderful performance. Love this movie! Love the excitement ad Amish themes. great Good movie, liked the combination of action and drama. Just a good old movie! Love this movie. Full of interest and suspense. Arrived in good condition and DVD plays well. A fine Modern movie in the 80s. Its about Harrison Ford in the Amish country. There is a love story as well, The main story as that an Amish kid witnesses a murder so Harrison Ford who is a Police investigator comes on the scene. True to life. Good movie Great Movie.! Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis carry this culture-clash story very well as hardened, honest big city detective grapples with bad guys in a bucolic Amish community. Thrown together by unusual circumstances, Ford and McGillis manage a touching, budding romance along the way to final justice where the ending leaves this viewer wanting to see how the next chapter unfolds, but alas there is no next chapter (darn!). watch Harrison Ford be Amish, bout sums it up GREAT. Love this movie. It starts slow, but if you turn your head, you'll miss the plot thickening. Once you're in you can't stop watching right to the end. No particular comment. Outstanding Film - I loved it when it first came out in the '80's and I watched it recently while visiting an Amish Community Good, early movie with Harrison Ford who is always good. Time will tell if Ford, known as heroic Han Solo and Indy Jones will return to his heroic status. It is hard for me to realize that when push came to shove and Ford was asked to support the pro-Sadam leftist in hollywood or our troups he blinked. He has been known for his financial support for Clinton, and thats fine. That is the way hollywood is. But support for proping up sadam?... and then he had his publicist try to explain away his apparent anti-american pro-french quotes... Anyway, my point is that Harrison Ford is arguably out best actor today. He plays the hero roles and the human interest roles very well. If the public stops accepting him as a hero, due to his politics then his excellent work in movies like WITNESS will come to dominate. I liked this movie, but it is not currently my favorite Ford movie. Maybe that will change over time. Good movie, enjoyed. Very original story and great actors. I saw this as a child at the theater and it has haunted me (in a good way) ever since. I think it is partly the music. Something very gripping about the movie. Great movie. EXCELLENT!! Great movie! AWESOME!!! Good movie. Shows another way of life. Outstanding good 'Witness' is probably Harrison Ford's best film, and when it was released it showed him another facet of a gifted actor who until then had been known only to most moviegoers only as Han Solo and Indiana Jones. In 'Witness', Ford is police detective John Book, called to interrogate a terrified little Amish boy named Samuel Lapp, and his young widowed mother. An undercover cop has been killed in the men's room at the railroad station, and Samuel, hiding in a stall, is the only eyewitness. Samuel is unable to identify the perp from the usual log of suspects; but there he is, posted prominently on the precinct bulletin board -- a decorated narcotics agent. When Book relates his findings to the police captain, he ends up getting shot himself -- seems the captain is in on it as well. With the captain, the narcotics agent, and a third dirty cop gunning for him, Book needs a place to hide, and what better place than the Lapp house deep in Amish country? The contrast between the gritty urban police precinct and the bucolic Amish farm country is one of the best things about the film. Book dressed in a blue shirt and black trousers several inches too short for him, looking like the proverbial fish out of the water, is a sight to behold. All of a sudden he's back in the nineteenth century -- no electricity, no cars, no TV or computers. He might as well be on another planet. And the Amish are as different from him as space aliens; gentle, quiet pacifists, hardworking and industrious, intent on keeping the outside world as far from them as possible. They are neighborly and cooperative; the barn-raising scene is inspiring to watch. We feel sympathy for these quiet, decent people as the outside world keeps encroaching, and see them trying to navigate a horse and buggy on the Interstate. Book has to try to fit into this world, and he gives it his best shot. He joins in the barn-raising, does odd chores around the farm. But the Amish, while they respect his abilities, hold him at arm's length. For one thing, he's falling in love with the young widow Lapp, whose feeling for him is mutual. For another, his assimilation is only skin-deep; on a trip into town, when a group of local louts start pestering the Amish, Book chips in with a right to the lout's nose that leaves his face a bloody mess. It's going to prove his undoing; back in his precinct, the narcotics agent and the captain have gotten wind of his hideout, and now they come to shut him up once and for all, and silence Samuel as well. In contrast to his one-note performances in the 'Star Wars' films and as Indiana Jones, Ford gives a much more nuanced performance in this film; he's the tough city cop on the one hand and the refugee who doesn't fit on on the other. Lukas Haas is very effective as the young boy Samuel, all big eyes and ears; and Kelly McGillis is excellent as his mother, torn between her feelings for Book and her ties to her Amish community; faced with the threat of being shunned for the rest of her life and cut off from everyone she knows if she marries him. There are several notable supporting performances as well, especially the late Alexander Godunov as the widow Lapp's admirer whose innate civility prevents him from expressing the resentment he feels at Books presence, and Danny Glover as the murderous narcotics detective. Peter Weir's sensitive direction plays up the contrast between time and place, sustaining the tension throughout the film. 'Witness' is not an action/adventure blockbuster like the movies that made Ford a household name, but it doesn't need pyrotechnics to stand out. It's a well-crafted, well-acted, eminently satisfying movie. I order it to show my Grandchildren both in their late teens. They loved it just like I did when I first saw it. It certainly held up over the years. Some of the most powerful romances can spring up when both sides have to be restrained; here, the widowed Amish woman and the cop-in-hiding know that they come from different worlds, know that a relationship between them will not practically work, and so fill the screen with unresolved sexual and romantic tension. Woven into the more grisly details of murder and police corruption are scenes of humor and beauty. Dancing in the barn to """"Don't Know Much About History"""". Having to wake up at 4 a.m. to milk the cows. It's funny to see how the cop, John Book, tries to fit himself into Amish life the best he can. And it's very moving to see his growing love for the Amish woman who nursed him through a bad gunshot wound and has enchanted him with her character and beauty. The movie's climax is also riveting; it's not often that one sees gunfighting at an Amish farm. As I write my title, it is weird to think this film is nearly 20 years old! How time flies! Anyway...I first saw this film when it first came out and I remember I really really liked it. I was 23 years old and not a Christian at that time. Now, I am soon to be 42 and have been a Christian for over 18 years. For 10 years of my life, I lived as a Mennonite (like Amish in many ways, but we drove cars, had electricity, etc.) I am no longer a Mennonite, and now I watch films again. I appreciate classic cinema very much, but recently have wanted to watch Witness again, to see if I would like it as much as the first time, and to see if I thought they portrayed the Amish correctly. So, I watched it last night. It was interesting in that I remembered so much, even some small details about it. So it really did impress me that first time when I was young. This time, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say it is a film I would watch over and over again, as I watch some classic films. To see it once more was enough to just satisfy my curiosity about my memories of it. I did feel they portrayed the Amish quite well, with the clothes and such. What they did wrong about the portrayal was that in no way would it be allowed for an Amish woman to tend to a wounded man who wasn't her husband, by herself in a room alone with him. It just isn't proper, isn't done. In reality, a man would have done that, or an older woman would have done it, with another woman there. I think the movie allowed the Rachel character to have way more """"access"""" to a man alone than would be allowed in a real Amish or Mennonite community. I doubt he would have really been allowed to stay in the house. In reality he would have been placed in a home with a family who had a bunch of boys and he would work with them and the father, and not have all that time alone with Rachel. I don't like violence...I knew that the bad part happened in the train station in the beginning, so we were able to fast forward that part. Also, we were able to fast forward the ending """"shoot out"""" stuff. I didn't care for the bad language. The scene with Rachel taking her sponge bath, well when I was young and not a Christian, I found that very romantic. Now, I found it rather silly. A devout"""	Witness
7376	"The daughter of the last Russian Tsar  Nicolas II  Anastasia is found by two Russian con men  Dimitri and Vladimir  who seek the reward that her grandmother  the Dowager Empress Marie  promised to the ones who'll find her. But the evil mystic of the Tsar family  Rasputin  still wants the Romanov family to be destroyed forever.Adventure Animation Children Drama Musical , animals animated animation based-on-true-story cartoon computer-animation cute disney disney-animated-feature fairy-tale family historical romantic russia talking-animals ,""This a great children-friendly account of the Anastasia Romanov situation. It is much better than Disney movies in that Anastasia actually has some backbone and a mind of her own- the scene where she slaps Dimitri comes to mind. The animation is great and my favorite song is """"Once Upon a December."""" Looks like Disney won't be the only company that produces high-quality animated features those days! I got to see it on Valentine's Day a few years before and I really like new twists in the usual fairy-tale storyline, like the young Anastasia going on a long journey with a handsome young man like they're longtime comrades and the 3-D animation of the train about to crash is really awesome! I also love how creepy and repulsive the villian is, especially when his body parts slowly comes apart to spook his poor little ablino bat familiar. And whether this movie matches the actual story about the fate of a Russian royal family or not, this is a pure fantasy containing fantasy elements like ghosts dancing about in a deserted courtroom. And on the other hand, there are quite a few things that I don't really like about this animated wonder: plucky young Anastasia eventually turns out to be a teensy-teenie little princess with a teensy-teenie waist, just like any other Disney heroine. And of course, she gets swept off her feet by young romantic love after all. I don't want to rehash everthing everyone has already said. I agree with most of it: the animation was good, the songs were wonderful, the characters were fasinating. I would, however, like to add a note in defense of the film's """"villians"""", Rasputian and Bartok. Christopher Lloyd was Rasputian, and he made Rasputian undoubtedly the best character villian in the history of animated films. He got so _into_ his role, obviously having a blast with his performance while at the same time doing a wonderful acting job. Rasputian's voice will send chills down your spine! I had no trouble believing that Rasputian was a """"real"""" person (yes, I _know_ he was a real person, but I am talking about his cartoon version), insane and totally determined to get revenge. A few have said that Bartok, the white albino bat that is Rasputian's sidekick, is an unnecessary character, but I disagree. KUDOS to Hank Azaria as Bartok; there was some much-needed comic relief in all of Bartok's lines. His timing was excellent, and he got the best lines of the film. A character was needed for Rasputian's lines and personality to bounce off of: Bartok is the ideal character, or bat, for the job! His sense of humor made the scenes all the more enjoyable, and were something of a grounding point. I can't explain it any better than that! To Hank Azaria; great job! This was a great movie, for kids and adults alike. Enjoy! . . . and see the film """"All Dogs Go To Heaven"""" while you're at it! :) This film succeeds on a number of levels: it has a gripping story, it has great animation, it has great characters, and it is technically wonderful. Though some may quibble at liberties taken with actual history (after all, Rasputin as an historical character differs most markedly with the film's character """"Rasputin""""), the movie DOES grippingly and unflinchingly cover the assassinations of the Romanovs; things are not """"prettied up"""" beyond recognition. The spin taken on the Anastasia legend is most interesting, and credible. The color, sound, and definition of the DVD version of this film are great! The extras are generous as well! This quality of animated film has not heretofore been found outside of the Disney studios, and is most welcome! Artistically this is one of the finest animated feature films produced by Don Bluth. Though best known for his work in the """"American Tail"""" movies, he is also responsible for """"The Secret of NIMH."""" This latest production shows what can be done when traditional hand-drawn animation is combined with computer technology. The result is superb. Outstanding animation matched with quality music and a reasonable plot merge to form an entertaining movie for children and adults alike. Sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy! For the animation lovers out there, watch for the details in the natural movements of the various characters. As for all the comparisons with Disney animation, I only ask why? The quality of Disney films varies greatly from film to film. Bluth has been far more consistent. Finally, the criticisms that this film isn't historically accurate are moot. Animated films rarely concern themselves with accuracy. Disney is one of the worst offenders. Disney's insistance on a happy ending comletely changed the story of """"The Little Mermaid"""" and """"Pocahontas"""" but they're still entertaining movies. Don Bluth is my hero, seeing American Tail in 1986 when I was barely four and and seeing a beautifully animated character who I could relate to (Feivel). Now I look back over the years, and realize that he can do anything. When he makes a movie, its never an """"Attempt"""", but always a masterpiece. I realize it was hard to depart from his beloved cels, because he is an old-fashioned animator, who is essentially a kid at heart. He has to be. In Anastasia, Bluth brings to life the story of the legendary Romanov Princess. I found the tale to be funny, but most of all, gripping. My favorite part was when the ghosts danced out of their paintings and danced with Anya in """"Once Upon a December"""". I found myself, watching alone whispering """"My God..."""" because it was the most incredible thing I have ever seen him do...well...one of them at least... ; ) Bottom line, if it says """"Don Bluth, Gary Goldman, John Pomeroy"""" on it...no matter what it is...Whether it be Pebble and the Penguin or Titan AE...American Tail or Anastasia...you are in for a treat. I bought this movie because I've been interested in the mystery of the Grand Duchess Anastasia since I was a kid, not because I have rugrats. This movie was entertaining. Anya is a spunky heroine; Dimitri is a scrappy hero; they have a sweet and surprisingly adult romance and the plot is more realistic (except for the ridiculous villain Rasputin) than expected. There is a lovely, melancholy song called """"Once Upon a December"""" that the amnesiac Anya sings in the empty palace as ghosts come out of paintings to dance with her. This movie isn't historically accurate, but it's a satisfying fairy tale -- the way we wish it had been. The staff who created this video did such a wonderful job and you can see their work through the extra's on the DVD. I truly commend them for their hard work. Also, to the voice actor's who did a wonderful job. And last, to the people who wrote and somewhat involve with the music soundtrack. Absolutely beautiful. The video and the sound was really good. In terms of child viewability, there are times when the dead Rasputin has limbs coming off and as a parent, it is your choice if you want them to watch it or not. Nevertheless the movie is just plain awesome! The extras...There are quite a few of them but they are long. From the games, puzzles and trailers to the featurette and a special documentary hosted by Alliyah, this is one DVD that I have to highly recommend. For a non-Disney animated film, this movie is definitely one of the best out there. Highly recommended! Now I know just as many others here have said that the Anastasia of real life never had the story that we have here, at least so we think. That's the fun of an unsolved mystery, you can make up the what if's. And so that is what we have here, A what if scenario given life by Twentieth century Fox and Don Bluth. And what a wonderful little story they tell. It is of a young woman who looks very much like Anastasia, but cannot remember her childhood. Will her seach for discovery lead her to finding that she is indeed the Princess Anastasia? Or will her hopes of finding a family be dashed in Paris? So we have as this story unfolds one of the first, if not the first, animated Movie that is aimed squarely at not only children but their parents as well. The addition of Bartok and Rasputin are definite adds for Children, but the rest of the Movie plays like a very nice romantic comedy. The animation is top notch, in fact after seeing this movie again, after recently having seen _Tarzan_ made me realize how good the animation really is. Personal tastes may vary, but I find the animation much better than most of Disney's work. The voice acting is very good. Meg Ryan plays the role of Anastasia, and John Cusak plays the role of Dimitri. The music is very good as well, and while they are not as memorable as _The Little Mermaid_ or _Beauty and the Beast_, they are still very good. As far as the DVD is concerned, I think Disney could learn a lot from Fox Video. We have a Making of documentary, a little featurette, the standard trailer stuff, and then two Sing-a-long songs that will definitely appear to the younger audience. If you are looking upon building a DVD library, especially if you have Kids or like animation, then this is a cannot miss purchase. Anastasia is one of the best animated movies that has ever been created. It surpasses Disney's constant futile attempts at animation which are always too cute for their own good. The best character in the movie is Rasputin(voiced by Christopher Lloyd and sung by Jim Cummings). His comical way of falling apart adds a likeable element to his personality and with his eerie ,but catchy tune """" In The Dark Of The Night"""". Christopher Lloyd really does an excellent job at bringing the spirit of Rasputin to life, and also, the comedic sidekick villain Bartok the albino bat brings a balanced out amount of evil in the villain to this movie. With witty dialogue and wonderful voice acting by Meg Ryan, Angela Lansbury, and John Cusack, this movie shines. Great songs also help too. Bartok is also funny. Did you see when tried to warn Rapustin of high blood pressure? That's a true classic. No matter what your age(I'm 14), Anastasia is bound to be a great piece of entertainment that will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. """"Anastasia"""" is my 2nd favorite Disney Animation movie (My most favorite one is """"The Quest for Camelot"""")!! It's got fun and lovely songs, very nice animation characters, and lots of excitement! This movie is great to watch with your family. This movie tells of the lost Russian princess Anastasia and her goal to find her true identity and how her family was killed by the curse of the evil sorceror, Rasputin (The revolution was the curse). When the revolution started in Russia, Anastasia, the royal family's youngest daugther, escapes barely with her life, but loses her memory when she tried to get on the train to Paris with her royal Grandmother. Anastasia falls from the train and hits her head but lives. Demetre, who was the kitchen boy when the fateful day had happened,and his assistant, Vladimer hears that the Empress(which is the Grandmother) offers a huge amount of money for the one who finds her lost Russian princess, Anastasia. Demetree and Vladimer tries to find someone who looks like Anastasia to fool the Empress and get away with the money. They meet Anastasia, who calls herself Ania, and she is trying to find a way to get to Paris. The reason she wants to go to Paris is because her Grandmother had given her a music box with a key to make the music play. Ania (or Anastasia) has the key but does"""	Anastasia

The story was modernized from the actual events. Great movie thanks Wonderful. I had forgotten this was a love story. Too much bad language. The idea was okay but the language ruined it for me. ok Thanks! Upgrading from DVDs. A great movie. great movie amazing performances by both leading actors! very good This movie is about 20 years old and was made when the lead actor (Matt Damon) was quite young. He plays the role of a genius who happens to be working as a janitor but somehow can figure out problems that no trained scientist could figure out. Though the movie has a solid story-line and good acting, I did not feel it deserves more than three stars due to the following weaknesses: 1) the supporting acting role was miscast to Ben Affleck whose acting appeared superficial and wooden 2) Matt Damon also does not come across as a typical janitor by appearance and upkeep of himself but later in the movie seems to be molding into his genius persona a bit better 3) Too many use of f-word in every sentence and loud yelling does not make up for deficiency in acting But generally, it is a respectable movie with a nice story though the ending is a bit stupid. It is fun to watch and to my liking where nobody gets killed. It seems to me the supporting role actors in the film outperform the lead characters, namely: Stellan Skarsgrd (as Professor Lambeau) and Minnie Driver (as Skylar). I gave it a sincere shot, I really did, but I could not make it all the way through this movie, not even for the final 20 minutes. Camera angles were fine, the way the story was told was fine, but I could not get into the story and I could not believe in the characters, nor could I care for them. I mean I like the premise of their being this kid with a troubled history, who just so happens to have a brilliant mind, but as fate would have it Mr. Damon never really struck me as exceptionally intelligent, in character or in real life. I mean he's no Neil Postman you know? As for the dialog and the plot surrounding this kid... well I could give a crap less, it was cliche' and utterly boring. I gave up, obviously. Great! An ordinary man that is extraordinary. Well done gentlemen. Product was as promised Robin Williams never disappoints. Very heart warming story line. My fav movie!!! Matt Damon is amazing. I was never a Robin Williams fan but loved him in this movie! gift Great movie! Better than anticipated Love you Robin... R.I.P. The Bluray looked really great... It tells a story of a young janitor who has been in and out of foster homes all his life and in trouble with the law, who is able to solve a complicated math equation to the surprise of many... He is able to overcome these things with the help of the math professor who sends him to his old college roommate who is a psychiatrist. The young boy also challenges the psychiatrist to face some of his personal issues. At this point no one needs a review of this movie - the Oscars weighed in on these star-studded performances long ago. I wanted it for my library so bought it. I've watched it many times, now as I do I am reminded Robin Williams is such a loss. love it Had heard a lot about this film and felt it was good acting, but only worth 4 stars. good one This one is a great movie Time-tested and True. Great acting, great directing, and excellent presentation. Never saw this movie until recently. The scenes with Damon and Williams are poignant as they work through issues together. Damon's outsider status in an exclusive club at MIT, Harvard, etc. is also interesting plot material. However, I did not care for every other word being an F-bomb and some crude attempts at humor. This could have been a PG-13 movie without the gratuitous language and still had a great story to tell. Great movie! Way more than you'd expect, plot, acting, just all well done. Worthy of five stars. Good flick! thoroughly enjoyed This item was perfect and was exactly what i was expecting. The item came in no time and was very well packaged and in a great shape. I'm very happy and pleased with the item i received and want to thank the seller for a terrific product. Great flick! Once again shows how versatile Robin Williams was! Excellent product! One of favorite Matt Damon Movies. I will miss Robin Williams, He was such a remarkable talent. Watch it, and remember. <3<3<3 Performances by Robin Williams and Matt Damon were great. Great movie. Well directed, well acted, with a wonderful message that wins the day. Good actors; good story line but the gratuitous use of the """"f"""" bomb added nothing to the story and actually detracted from it. Martin Scorsese must have had something to do with the dialog because he bathes in the """"f"""" word in his movies Good acting, better theme. Genius is where you find it. Always excellent. Watch should I expect with Robin Williams involved? Incredible movie with incredible talent writing and acting in it. Classic movie, good actors, good storyline. Great performances. another great movie, worth watching Saw it for the second time. Even better than the first time. Yes we know it's clever A+++ I didn't like this movie and stopped watching it after 15-20 minutes. I don't understand why it was so highly praised. I did not give it 5 stars, only 1. Awesome Movie. A must see. Anything will Robin Williams is a must see, even though Matt Damon was the main guy. Matt Damon's performance was awesome. An extraordinary film. It is no wonder that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won for best screenplay. This movie made cry the first time I saw it. I think everyone can relate to not fitting in or having a bunch of friends that you end up having to leave. But the actors did this so well. Robin Williams, you will always be in my heart. And Matt Damon did a superb job of being that young man with so inner hurt. I enjoyed this movie and hope everyone sees once in their lifetime. GOOD Robin Williams was wonderful...........but the film lacked a certain """"je ne sais quoi"""". Great movie. Was super happy to add this to my collection. One of the best movies ever made in the U.S.A. Watch it and learn about friendship, society, ivory tower politics/hierarchy and hard-time economics of blue-collar workers. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Period. GREATEST FILM ALMOST....EVER It's a good movie. A great movie. Really like this one. Awesome Movie Obviously one of the best movies these guys have ever made. A very powerful movie that is more than worth your time to watch. a classic movie to share with family Excellent One of my personal top ten movies all-time. Dialogue driven masterpiece. Very quotable I really enjoyed this movie. Must watch Robin Williams movie I have not finished it yet tho One of the best movies of all time. Coming to grips with the things that haunt you from your past and accepting them (probably not as """"quickly"""" as it shows in the movie) and moving on to a better life is the best lesson of this movie. The scene that always makes me cry is when Robin Williams' character tells Matt Damons' character that """"it's not your fault"""". Robin Williams as his best! Excellent movie. Great cast and great acting. An older movie but a Feel Good story that made me glad I watched it again. With so many violent, killing crime movies in theaters, it was positively Wonderful spending a couple of hours, knowing movies like this can still be found. The acting of Matt Damon shows why he is still one of the best around. We saw a great talent in Robin Williams that showed why we loved him. I wish there were more of this caliber films to enjoy. One of the best Matt Damon and Robin Williams movies to own! A must have! wonderful...very wonderful great story Excellent movie! Great story, superb acting. I can see why this movie won so many awards and accolades! One of my favorite movies of all time. Phenomenal performances by Robin Williams, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck. Definitely a must see.

Enjoyable beginning to end. Robbin Williams was alway a pleasure to see in movies. Wonderful acting-great script! Very good movie This movie is about acting Mat and Robin really do fine the spark between them in this movie. And its all of the actors playing very good parts and feeding off each other. Yes, other well made movies but this and a few more are the last of great movies. Thanks for adding this movie and I'd sit down and watch this again. Great movie. Great cast. Well done Matt and Ben! Wonderful entertaining movie nan good movie A+++ Way too much gross stuff to give it a higher rating. Not just bad language, but story line to go with it. Amazing! A+++ A classic that stands the test of time. Excellent performances from Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Great look at interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships. Made me quite introspective Very boring Okay, it's not a 5 star flick, but pretty close. One of the better movies ever made. awesome I have made several purchases with Deep Discount DVD.

Absolutely littered with profanity and graphic innuendo. Definite on my top ten if not top 5 list. This was a very good movie with an all star cast. However, I would have enjoyed it a LOT more if the """"F"""" word had not been used in almost every sentence. I am not a prude, but this was totally overdone - the use of this word. Excellent story line and performances. This movie gets better every time I see it. His speech to the NSA is classic.

One of the best movies ever! I always found it a cruel film. Cameron's delight in showing human suffering always seemed odious to me. Not surprising, given the man. Not for kids.

The deleted scenes and, I believe, a number of the other special features, are available on the DVD """"Special Collector's Edition,"""" which is over $10 more expensive than this edition. Maybe it's just assumed these days that everything on these joint releases is on Blu-Ray, except for the movie itself. That's certainliy okay, if such is the case, and it would be better if the home page on amazon for the release specified as much. What's not to like about this flick? Great cast, riveting story, and based on history. I rent it again and again. I might have preferred the movie if it was originally released on 3D. Having seen this movie several times already, makes it difficult to sit another three hours to enjoy the 3D. I bought it out of curiousity and my enjoyment of 3D movies. But, if you have the Blue Ray version, this one need not be bought. Unless you are a 3D freak the retelling of the tragic boat story stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet this film also features a love story between the 2 stars and how sometimes love can conquer all boundaries Starring Leonardo DiCapprio with Kate Winslet and director James Cameron, the film opens with an exploration of the submerged Titanic. An interesting discovery puts the explorers in contact with an elderly woman who was there in April 1912. Rose recounts her arrival as a newly engaged 1st class passenger. She felt trapped in her life until she accidentally met Jack, a 3rd class drifter who won his ticket in a poker game. After he saves her life, their forbidden relationship continues as they spend more time together. Jack, who is an artist, even does a charcoal drawing of Rose. However, all too soon the unsinkable ship hits an iceberg and chaos ensues in the following hours. Heroically, once again Jack keeps Rose alive although he himself perishes in the cold. Back in the present Rose now keeps him alive with her memories. This epic romance is fairly good with a semi-autobiographical story, special effects, and a decent score. This is one of my favorite Movies. Thanks very much. My grandson cannot wait to see it on Blue ray. Thanks yes i love this product. i will buy again if time and money permit. looking forward to a purchase again when. to sum up A review, this movie was excellent I have watched this movie 13 times, and I could watch it again, I really go for these ,movies that depict disaster, that, and the steamy love affair scene, S, A MUST SEE in my book, definitely A """"two thumbs up"""" Excellent movie. I'm still suffering a little hypothermia from this movie. It looks so good in 3D that I was a little surprised I don't have wet feet! Replaced my VHS, total classic. I love the movie but disc 2 of my Titanic 3D Blu Ray's sound is out of sync. Disc 1, perfect. 2D version, perfect. But disc two is about a second out of snyc. I have a new Sony 3D all region player. Any help? Not my first Journey but still loved it! Classic, what more can I say? :) I don't have to tell anyone what a great movie this is. it speakes for itself. Very well acted and great job on special affects The 3D was remarkably well done considering the film wasn't originally filmed in 3D. It was not as amazing as Avatar but awesome nonetheless. One noteworthy scene where the 3D added to the movie was when the water was filling the ship, you could actually see and """"feel"""" the depth of the water. In many scenes, the sense of depth helped to get you immersed in the room of the ship or note the nuances to the character's face. The only gimmicky use of the 3D was the intentional """"pop-out"""" of the Blu-ray menu, otherwise, the use of 3D in the Blu-ray version of Titanic was tastefully used to enhance immersion into the movie. Even though I would have preferred a digipack, or digibook, or steelbook edition (like the old 4-disc DVDs), this is a great purchase. Not that this is bad, it's just that I don't like the blue plastic boxes. Personal taste... The image and sound are simply perfect. The extra features too. Good purchase. Great, great movie. Everyone needs to watch it once. ok I got this for my wife she loves this movie and to get it in 3D now she can love it more and enjoy it with her mom and sister. This movie won the many Oscars and I loved this movie when I was around at that the time but I was disappointed with the 3D effects though that could be because we probably have the wrong TV to project 3D but then most people complain that 3D is good but doesn't show much as Disney thrill rides! Avatar was better in 3D then this one! who does not like a love story, even when it doesn't have a great ending. I would have loved to walk on that ship before it sailed just to see for myself how great it was inside. 3d effects were very well done. Mde an already great movie even greater. Too bad it wouldn't fit on one disc. I have owned this move on DVD back in the day. While this is a great movie, I won't get into the film itself, just more of the Blu Ray Quality. I do own a 3D TV, I must say that the 3D version of the movie is not impressive, there is no pop out effect, """"some might call it gimmick"""" but some movies just have no business being in 3D. The only part that looks good in 3D out of the whole 3 hour movie, is the sinking part, and it's only when Rose is """"saving jack"""" from being held as a prisoner. The quality of Blu Ray, as far as the 2D image is awesome. It creates a GREAT sound, depth, and the movie looks as if it was shot in 2009, much closer than 1995-1997. However it does make old Rose's wrinkles look much worst because of the clarity. If you are a movie collector, I recommend owning the Blu Ray version of Titanic. By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com """"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."""" In the history of the world, the best example of giving ones life to save the life of another is found in the true story of the Titanic disaster; not the OK fictional story of Jack and Rose on the Titanic, but the true historical event of so many men giving up their seats in the lifeboats to save the lives of women and children. Next to the story of the Titanic about people willing to die to save the life of others, is the sculpture of the """"Burghers of Calais"""", and a 12 minute film entitled """"Greater Love."""" The story of the """"Burghers of Calais"""" is found in a sublime sculpture by the artist Rodin It is a monument to an occurrence in 1347 during the Hundred Years' War, when Calais, a French village was under siege by the English for over a year. England's King Edward offered to spare the people of the city if any six of its top leaders would surrender presumably to be executed. Edward demanded that they walk out wearing nooses around their necks to give their lives for their village. It is reported that they actually did this and then were spared by the intervention of England's Queen who persuaded her husband to exercise mercy by claiming that their deaths would be a bad omen for her unborn child. No less than the above, is the simple story told in a 12 minute film called """"Greater Love"""" which is about a little girl who gives a blood transfusion to save the life of her brother. Believing that the transfusion would end her life, she then asks the question. """"When am I going to die?"""" To give ones life to save the life of another is reflection of the Atonement of Jesus Christ who died that we might live after death. This even """"greater love"""" that God has for his children is represented in a ten minute film called """"The Bridge"""" which is the story of a father who operates a railroad bridge. When his little boy comes out on the RR tracks of the bridge, the father must make a decision of whether to save the people on the train (you and I and everyone who has ever lived) or to sacrifice his son. He allows his son to die for all mankind to live. """"For God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten son..."""" Jews and Muslims relate the story to Abraham's offering his son (Isaac or Ishmael) as a sacrifice. """"The Bridge"""" is an even better analogy and schoolmaster because no lives were being saved by Abraham's sacrifice. The film is a bridge between man and God, a bridge between our mortal life and a life after death, and a bridge between Christians, Jews, and Muslims. For these reasons, I believe """"The Bridge"""" is the most important motion picture ever produced. See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives. Darrell Stoddard, Founder - Pain Research Institute healpain.net and saveusa.biz This movie deserves 5 stars because it is the greatest movie known to man kind. It bring tears of joy and pain all at once! It is amazing! Yeah, the perfect chick flick... While it could seem longer, it is better than other editions, you have to getthis if you, like my wife love this movie. It looks awesome, it sound great and will be prfect while the family is gathering in a holiday. This is one of about twenty I can watch over and over. With a digital download the price can't be beat.

7400	"The Tibetans refer to the Dalai Lama as 'Kundun'  which means 'The Presence'. He was forced to escape from his native home  Tibet  when communist China invaded and enforced an oppressive regime upon the peaceful nation of Tibet. The Dalai Lama escaped to India in 1959 and has been living in exile in Dharamsala ever since.Drama , amazing-cinematography beautifully-filmed biographical biography biopic breathtaking cerebral china cinematography complex great life-&-death meditative original reflective storytelling stunning visual visually-appealing visually-stunning ,""great good movie The film title """"Kundun"""" refers to the name given to the 14 Dalai Lamas of Tibet. Each was a young boy when selected, and then trained to be Tibet's spiritual and temporal leader. The present Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was forced to grow up quickly when Mao Zedong's forces took over mainland China in 1949. At first, Tenzin labored patiently to reconcile differences and forge an agreement with Mao's government over the status of Tibet. After a meeting with Mao, however, the Dalai Lama suspected that his days in Tibet were numbered. Although a gracious host, Mao made it a point to end their meeting with the following words, """"Before you leave, there is one thing you must know: Religion is poison. It ignores material progress and keeps people backwards. We have a new China now."""" Although """"Kundun"""" seems unusual for a Martin Scorsese effort, it need make no apologies. This fine movie highlights the spirituality and courage of the 14th Dalai Lama. He is a leader on the world stage, as well as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize (1989), the (US) Congressional Gold Medal (2007), and the Templeton Prize (2012). Fr. Dennis A year ago I upgraded my DVD player to blu ray and began the slow process of replacing my older favorite films with blu ray discs. I was often disappointed by the upgrade. While I could usually count on better clarity in the picture, the colors could be very off, even horrible. Outdoor scenes awash in a blue-green tint not seen anywhere in nature and clothing that changed hue from one scene to the next spoiled the purchase. """"Kundun"""" is my favorite movie, and I think the best film Scorsese ever made. When Sunday morning political shows fail to grab my interest, this is the film that gets popped into the player. I have seen it many times. I was slow to make the upgrade because of my previous bad experiences, but a good price at Yesasia.com and the Christmas spirit prompted my purchase. What joy! Absolutely no problems with the color or clarity. Picture is as clean and clear as a Philip Glass musical score. So if you are hesitating to upgrade, don't. You will not be disappointed. When Disney was making the movie, the Chinese government told it to stop or face stoppage in the construction of the Disneyland in Shanghai, China. Disney didn't stop the making of the movie and the Disneyland was delayed for about 10 years. This is an amazing film. One that not only uses no famous actors but is a visual masterpiece showing the yearly years of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Martin Scorsese captured the time, the environment, the history and with Phillip Glass' haunting score, an amazing watch. I highly recommend. Everything about this movie is wonderful. I certainly love the music and sounds of this movie. The acting, the cast, the clothing is perfect. The story is really a history of the beginning years of the Dalai Lama, the story of Tibet, the conquest of and the Tibet. You even get some insight in the Chinese military and the inner thoughts of religion of Mao Zedong. It is the story of the Dalai Lama from birth till the escape from Tibet. You also get some insights into the religion of Buddhism. The movie shows you some of the training of the Dalai Lama as a child. Also you get to see the customs of Mahayanna Buddhism. Just a magnificent movie. Scorcese's masterpiece about HH Dalai Lama is brilliant and beautiful from start to finish. You can almost smell the incense burning in the fantastic Monastic scenes. This film is great medicine for a bad mood or depression. Philip Glass soundtrack works perfectly here. If you want to know more about HH Dalai Lama then this film will upload info to your brain quicker than most anything. Follow up with meditation for best results. Om Mani Peme Hung More emphasis to reality was given- sad but true Kudos to director Martin Scorsese's story of the birth of the Dalai Lama. Although this is not what one would call a mass audience picture, anyone who is interested in Eastern culture or in the meditative arts will derive much from this film. Compared to the slick, Hollywoodish, """"Seven Years in Tibet"""" with Brad Pitt in the lead, I found this film to be more enlightening but the other film has its own virtues too--perhaps a way of introducing just what Tibetian culture is all about thru the eyes of a European. Nevertheless, both films are recommended for students interested in spirituality. Om Mani Padme Hum This was with out a doubt the dumbiest movie I have ever seen in fact it is to me the worst movie of the year. So I do not reccomen this movie to any one. After making Casino-one of the most disappointing flicks of his stellar career-wasn't it about time Scorcese turned his sights back to more serious, weighty matters. Kundun's plot is unconventional by Hollywood standards and might be just plain boring to those expecting a gory Asian massacre. But like Scorcese's shamefully unseen The Last Temptation of Christ, Kundun brings a human touch to a worshipped man-our sympathies extend beyond mere reverence. While it fails to completely unravel the core character of the Dalai Lama, it brings awareness to the beauty and the suffering of one of the most tragic and tranquil lives of this century. This has been one of my favorite films since its release in 1997. A few months ago I looked for the regular dvd in my collection of over 500 without finding it. I decided I must have loaned it and forgotten who. I bought the blu ray version for my home theater. The incredible picture and sound made my wife and me estatic with our purchase even though its price was higher than we are accustomed to paying. There are multiple storylines which make this film appeal to those with an interest in history, spirituality, geography, politics and the essence of humanity. An unforgettable cinema experience to be repeated every year or two. This is a very informative film directed by Martin Scorsese in which he portrays the life of the fourteenth, the present, Dalai Lama, from childhood through the Chinese occupation of Tibet and his exile into India. The Buddhists believe that the soul of the first Dalai Lama is reincarnated into another person after he dies and that this person has some recollections of his former existence. Thus it is interesting to see how the monks discover that this child is the reincarnated Dalai Lama. It is also fascinating to watch how he is treated, how he matures, the plight of Tibet, the behavior of the Chinese, and the life and suffering of the Tibetan people. I don't think I will find all the right adjectives to relay to you just how magnificent and wonderful this movie is and on just how many different levels. First of all, the performances by all involved are astonishing. Wonderfully understated and beautiful. The story is uplifting and tragic at the same time, bravo martin Scorcese. Once again politics proves to be the poisonous viper in the world tree. When Tibet needed aid while the Chinese under Mao attacked and overtook their country, no one would help because there was nothing of interest to anyone outside that c\would make it worthwhile. No oil, gems, nothing. So poor Tibet and the Dalai Lama specifically were being targeted, the people murdered in the streets, families forced to kill each other. But the British, the US would do nothing, Are you surprised? Finally the Indians took the Dalai lama in. I love ythis world and it is so sad the things that guide it. I have three kids and spend a lot of time watching animated hits for the second or third time. My kids stayed with Kundun from beginning to end and had plenty of great questions. I honestly felt transformed by the movie. I can't remember the last time I took the time to review anything, but it's the least I can do in return. This is a beautiful film, in both style and subject matter. The scenes and cinematography are outstanding and the story of the Dalai Lama's early life and exile are fascinating to watch. This is a great place to go if you wish to learn about this turbulent time in Tibet and isn't too biased or 'Hollywood' either. Great! Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page. Will not tell much about the movie; if you are reading this, you probably know it. I particularly love it, it is one of my favourite ones ever. I just wanted to tell you that this is maybe the best blu-ray I have ever seen. The image is just perfect; crystal clear, sharply detalied, beautifully saturated colors. In a movie with such a miraculous cinematography, where light, colors and textures are the key to its very breathing heart, this is saying a lot. High-definition technology would be worth even if it were only for this movie. I don't know why it is so awfully expensive, or, in my case, so difficult to find (it took me months to find the very affordable Spanish edition), but it is really worth it. I just couldn't believe my eyes, honestly. KUNDUN is Martin Scorsese's grandly episodic biographical film of the life and times of Tenzin Gyatso, the XIV Dalai Lama, the """"Kundun"""" of the title. Although Mr. Scorsese is best known for his gangster epics MEAN STREETS, GOODFELLAS and CASINO and for studies in violence such as RAGING BULL and TAXI DRIVER, his films can all be seen as studies in the condition of the human individual (AVIATOR), and how that individual comes to terms with the Spirit within himself (THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST and KUNDUN). KUNDUN is unique among Scorsese's films for lacking an A-List lead, and is in fact unique among films as the """"authorized biography"""" of its subject. The XIV Dalai Lama was intimately involved in the making of this film, and most of the sequences in KUNDUN were drawn from his living memory. The actors in KUNDUN are the Dalai Lama's niece (as his own mother) and his grandnephew (as himself), and while the acting is unpolished it is heartrendingly sincere. From the time he is discovered to be the reincarnation of the XIII Dalai Lama, Kundun's life is strictly proscribed. A sweet, precocious little boy whose compassionate nature makes him pet puppies and separate fighting beetles, he is taken away from Takster, his home town in Amdo Province, and brought to Lhasa, where he grows up within the """"old and dark"""" walls of the Dalai Lama's vast and ancient Palace, the Potala. Although his upbringing among adult monks seems sad and drear and he admits to loneliness, his is also a life of great pomp and circumstance. As the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, Kundun is both indulged and delimited in his choices. Among the gold statues and rich silks, rats are seen to scurry hither and yon, even while the eldest greybeards prostrate themselves before him. Although he does show a few youthful inclinations toward arbitrariness, he outgrows these quickly. Interestingly, Heinrich Harrer, His Holiness' adult friend who introduces him to the West (and is the narrator and chief character of SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET) never appears in KUNDUN (both movies were released in 1997; the cast and crews of both pictures were forever banned from China for making these films). A curious boy, he wants to know how things work, where places are, and what the politics of his kingdom portend. Although he is shielded somewhat from the harsher realities of life, circumstance dictates that he assume the mantle of power in youth. China, long having claimed Tibet as its"""	Kundun

Very loosely. Set in modern times, it moves from the Florida Gulf Coast to New York with certain key elements familiar to readers of the original story. There's a young boy who encounters a convict played by Robert DiNiro as a Mafioso. There's an eccentric old lady, played by a Anne Bancroft who wears brightly colored designer clothes, smokes cigarettes and guzzles martinis. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the icy young lady with cool detachment. And Ethan Hawke is cast as the young man, a bit too much of a hunk for the role which is written to have him become the darling of the art world. There's a lot of star power here, and some nudity, but not much else. The script does not do justice to Dickens' intentions. We've come to expect good cinematography these days and so I must say that the Florida gulf coast really did look good. What is lacking, however, is the dark brooding atmosphere. In some respects this is a pleasant video although it moves too slowly and never grabbed my emotions. Gwyneth Paltrow does look pretty. And Robert DiNiro gives an excellent performance. But in a world where we can make choices about our entertainment, there's a lot better out there. And if Charles Dickens were alive today, I'm sure he would agree. This was, a good movie I liked it the performences were great, I don't read Charles Dickins books but this was a good movie you'll like it hopefully. This film has virtually nothing to offer. Robert De Niro is out of place (as much as I value his talent). Hawke is kind of weird, especially in his badly executed """"teenage"""" look. The New York's Art Scene is highly irritating, as is the """"eccentric aunt"""" most of the times. I think Paltrow's nude picture on the cover helped to promote this film. Better than average Gwyneth Paltrow movie based on the Dickens novel of the same name. Though the purists may howl it is not a bad effort at a contemporary retelling of this old victorian favourite. All the better for having such an exemplary cast led by Robert de Niro as the magwitch character and Anne Bancroft playing it for all its worth as the senile and eccentric Nora Dinsmoor. A worthy successor to the aged and abandoned Mrs Haversham. I just loved her...and pitied her. What a tragic sight. Director Cuaron transfers his story from the misty and fog bound moors to the sunny ambience of 1997-Miami. Funnily it works. Ethan Hawke as Finn the central character and whos acting skills I had serious doubts about manages to age effortlessly here from inadequate teenager to confident but lovelorn adult. So maybe the man can act!. Chris Cooper also does a wonderful portrayal as Joe, Finn's kindly brother-in-law, abandoned by Finn's faithless sister he captures an image of pathos when he finds himself out of place at Finns first gallery opening. A first rate actor who is in no danger of being typecast. In the end Gwyneth carries the movie as the distantly cold and enigmatic Estelle. She gives new meaning to aloofness. Amazingly in her brief career she has yet to play two similar types in any of her films. A recommended film for those nights when nothing better is on the box. Enjoy. I'm not going to claim that I have seen the original, nor remember reading the boring novel in literature class, but I did see this DVD. This movie is exceptional, stylish, and captivating. Ethan Hawke is brilliant, as the son of a poor handyman, who falls hard for the daughter of a bitter, old wealthy widow(played exceptionally by Anne Bankroft). The real show-stealer is Gwyneth Palthrow, the object of Hawke's affections, as an iceberg princess, incapable of love or emotion. This film shows that no matter what success we achieve in life, it is all hollow without the affections of those we care about most. Who cares about Charles Dickens and David Lean, this version of """"Great Expectations"""" stands alone. Director Alfonso Cuaron (along with his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and production designer Bo Welch from """"A Little Princess"""") have created another cinematic work of stunning visual beauty. It is no coincidence that Lubezki and Welch helped to create the distinctive look of some of director Tim Burton's films. """"Great Expectations"""" simply glows on the screen and is a must own on DVD. Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, and a wonderful music score join the trio of aforementioned men to create a film that is absolutely mystical in its impact. I can't wait for Cuaron's next film. We've all heard of the debacle that was """"Heaven's Gate""""-a movie who's cost skyrocked out of control when a director's autonomy and self-indulgence became it's downfall. The result was ultimately the demise of what was United Artists. The after effect was to limit a great deal of studio production subsequent-everyone was just too scared to produce anything. Great Expectations may be a mini- Heaven's Gate. A production where costs obviously skyrocketed out of control until the whole thing was cut off entirely. I can imagine the picture was taken from the director, and finished by some hired help, such is the odd assortment that ultimately went to the screen. What's left is a few odd pieces, joined with spit and bailing wire. The adaptation and contemporary update of the Charles Dickens' classic makes little or no sense. The dang thing's been made so many times already I'm not even sure why this deal ever got started. Talented actors such as Robert DeNiro, Chris Cooper, and Gwyneth Paltrow are framed by confusing dialogue and incomplete ideas. The look is a pretentious, over-blown music vid approach with an inappropriate and nagging score. A complete waste of time. I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She hates me so she refused to watch it. So it's basically like a win-win cause I get to keep the movie and she gets to scorn me by refusing my gift. Isn't life wonderful ??? Anyway, it's a pretty cool movie. Robert Deniro kills in it. You'll be...uh....watching Ethan Hawke's performance...like a hawk. I always did like this movie. You should watch it. Why ??? Because it's definitely better than being forced to watch """"Nanny Mcphee"""" at gun point while slightly off to your left a tour guide from Sea World gestures toward a plate of sloppy joe's which you would rather sign up for the draft than eat. This is an absolutely terrible film. The classic simply cannot translate credibly this way to the world portrayed here, where all is manipulated so thoroughly into the """"generation X"""" mould (bodies, dialogue, milieu, music, etc.). Much like the 60's updates of the classics, the personalities, attitudes, and fashions therein belong so completely to its own period that the passage of few years will be needed to date it embarrasingly. Always intended as grist for the hedonistic masses (like """"Titanic""""), the film-makers make no attempt to break out of the conventions of teen soapers. A sloppy job is done in unifying the script, as--unlike in the original--the two stories of the girl and the convict are not yoked here, and thereby rendering one or the other irrelevant. Dialogue is dull and often banal. Paltrow looks anorexic. DeNiro is his usual smarmy, hammy self. Attempts at humor are emetic. The cinematography, for all the accolades, lacks original style and texture. The mediocre musical score tells us what to feel. In conclusion, the best advice is to stick to David Lean's 1946 adaptation of """"Great Expectations."""" This brilliant realization, on the other hand, not only does decisive justice to the original novel and period, it does not date in the least. Lean's masterpiece remains as immediate and poignant today as it was in 1946 (see my review at Amazon!). I have to admit, I'm one of the only Dickens fans I know that actually enjoyed this retelling. For me, the intense focus on the relationship between Stella and Finn (Pip) urged me to re-read the novel for a fourth time, in an entirely new light. If you haven't read the book, it focuses much more on Pip's ascendancy to success than on his lovelorn frustrations with Stella. Yes, concentrating on this relationship was a typical Hollywood maneuver, but the outcome is the creation of an entirely renovated sub-story, definitely one worthy of telling. Modernized story, great art, and an interesting soundtrack all contribute to a funky paradigm of the original text. I loved it precisely because it didn't try to be the book. The direction is beautiful, the scenery is gorgeous. The only thing that kept me from giving this movie five stars, was the sappy Hollywood ending. Maybe they should have called this remake """"Great Expectations Fulfilled."""" This story was excellent! My favorite movie (1 of a few) of all time. Love Love Love it so I bought it! I've come to realize that most people that see an adaptation of a novel on the screen hate it not because one is better than the other (regardless- this may be the case), but because the book enjoyed FIRST. Yes, it's all about being FIRST. This movie is second in most people's lives.. except mine. I watched this movie first, loved it, and then went out to the library to read the actual novel. I must say, the movie is better. I felt there was more of a balance between the two storylines (no spoilers, sorry), and that the soundtrack and cinematography added so much to the story. It's a beautiful piece of film, and I truly do recommend it. I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but what I pulled out of it was some serious-good-stuff. (Speaking of the soundtrack, the best song on it is by Mono.. and I think the song is called Mono. It's a great song, and is played throughout.) At first I thought it might be a little too slow for my tastes, but the pace was perfect for the story, so I didn't mind at all. Check it out if you can. Played well, and is a great movie. This is a great makeover (not a remake) of the English 1946 black and white film which was much closer to the Dickens original both in time and setting when it begins: South East England just after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the Thames Estuary where one can discern the floating hulks of pensioned off warships stripped of masts and rigging and turned into holding prisons for felons awaiting transportation to Australia. In this 1998 version the time is the late twentieth century and the setting is the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico off the South Western Florida coast, faraway from the more fashionable Florida Gold Coast on the Atlantic Ocean side. Any filmmaker today who dared to remake the 1946 film would be doomed to failure as it would be a hard, if not impossible act to follow. Having said that the newer film is a gem precisely because the producers did not make that mistake and for a score of other creditable reasons as well, not least the superb cinematography and soundtrack. It is as if a builder were told to reconstruct a beautiful aging mansion but to keep the facade and the basic structure while having complete liberty to do whatever he felt best for the interior. The 1998 film is therefore the modernised version of Great Expectations, probably close to what Dickens would have actually written had he been alive today. The filmmakers have preserved much of the novel's structure and a little of the facade but have gone to incredible lengths to put a new stamp on it, with considerable success. Let me say that the much esteemed 1946 black and white English movie had its faults. John Mills who played the part of"""	Great Expectations

7469	"""Last Days of Disco loosely depicts the """"last days"""" at a disco palace  where drugs  sex and weirdness ran rampant. The story centers around a group of friends who frequent the disco and each other. All the characters are searching for something to make their lives more fulfilling. Some are searching for everlasting love and some are just wanting something different. As the disco is closed  they all wonder can disco ever really be dead  ""Comedy Drama , awesome-soundtrack cerebral dialogue dialogue-driven ensemble-cast entirely-dialogue independent-film intellectual new-york original quotable relationships talky ,""The best part about the movie is the cover. Kate Beckinsale looks grrrreat! Chloe can act as well. I first reviewed this film and trashed it after watching the first 1/2-3/4 but then went back and finished it and surprisingly enjoyed the rest of it. Ok but worth $150 because it's out of print? No way. Somehow I got intrigued by The Last Days of Disco by writer, director, and producer Whit Stillman. I saw it in the video section of the Bakersfield Library, and kept thinking that someday I would check it out--but then when I got up the gumption to really do it, it was gone! I kept checking and rechecking on its status until finally it was back. I rushed home to watch it and despite all the hype--albeit self-induced--I was not disappointed. It exceeded my expectations. Compare and contrast it to 54, with Mike Meyers, Ryan Phillippe, and Salma Hayek, because it tells a similar story, focusing on a nightclub at the height and end of the disco era. The disco itself is the central character in both films, and both are brought down by the decadence of the era, and also for tax evasion. The story in both cases is told through the eyes of a group of people who either work at or frequent the discos. I like both films, but TLDOD prevailed. Whit Stillman has only written, directed, and produced 3 films so far--besides TLDOD, Barcelona and Metropolitan--both are similar to TLDOD in that they all start off as a comedy of manners but progress to a more dramatic story once the quirky characters have been established. All three films star the quirky and enigmatic Chris Eigeman. You may not know who he is unless you are a fan of the films of Whit Stillman, as he was in all three of those, but he was on The Gilmore Girls and I first noticed him in commercials for Pacific Bell where he created a very memorable character who always wore a dark suit and tie, no matter how inappropriate the situation. Though he seemed smart and witty, you got the feeling he probably still lived in his mother's basement. It was uncanny how he could convey so much in such a short segment. He was the forerunner of the """"can you hear me now?"""" guy. In TLDOD he was Des McGrath, who worked at the disco in his spare time when he wasn't dumping women by pretending to be gay. You might think at the start that you would be rooting for Jimmy (Mackenzie Astin), who works at an ad agency, and whose major responsibility was getting their clients into the disco. Or perhaps the handsome Tom Platt, an environmental lawyer who collects Scrooge McDuck comics. He is played by Robert Sean Leonard (Peter M&uuml;ller in Swing Kids). -------------------- Tom Platt: Actually, there's one theory that the environmental movement of our day was sparked by the re-release of Bambi in the late 1950s. =============== You never would have guessed that Assistant District Attorney Josh Neff (Matt Keeslar), who is sickeningly sincere in his love of Disco, yet is instrumental in bringing the whole temple crashing down on everyone's heads, would emerge as the most sympathetic of the men; followed by the """"smarmy braggart of the most obnoxious kind"""" not to mention """"all-around sleaze ball,"""" Des McGrath. In one key scene Josh Neff analyzes the social ramifications of the Disney classic """"Lady and the Tramp"""" thusly: ---------------- Josh Neff: [referring to Lady and the Tramp] There is something depressing about it, and it's not really about dogs. Except for some superficial bow-wow stuff at the start, the dogs all represent human types, which is where it gets into real trouble. Lady, the ostensible protagonist, is a fluffy blond Cocker Spaniel with absolutely nothing on her brain. She's great-looking, but - let's be honest - incredibly insipid. Tramp, the love interest, is a smarmy braggart of the most obnoxious kind - an oily jailbird out for a piece of tail, or... whatever he can get. Charlotte Pingress: Oh, come on. Josh Neff: No, he's a self-confessed chicken thief, and all-around sleaze ball. What's the function of a film of this kind? Essentially as a primer on love and marriage directed at very young people, imprinting on their little psyches the idea that smooth-talking delinquents recently escaped from the local pound are a good match for nice girls from sheltered homes. When in ten years the icky human version of Tramp shows up around the house, their hormones will be racing and no one will understand why. Films like this program women to adore jerks. =============== Josh Neff also had a mental breakdown in his past and now must maintain his even keel with lithium, but still, in spite of his put down of a beloved Disney icon, he emerges as the strongest candidate. Des defends Tramp, and even though there is more than a bit of the tramp about him, he still has a certain amount of raffish charm. The real lead, though, is Alice Kinnon (Chlo Sevigny), who works at a publishing house and has ambitions to be an editor, or at least an assistant editor, instead of a mere editor's assistant. She is smart but listens too much to the bad advice of her friend Charlotte Pingress (Kate Beckinsale). Charlotte embodies all that is wrong with that selfish Disco era, of those who strove to be yuppies, though assistants weren't really professionals, no more than were nightclub flunkies like Des. She professes to be Alice's friend, but she is a forerunner of what would come to be known as the """"frenemy."""" Charlotte tells Alice that she is coming off like too much of a strict kindergarten teacher, and to counteract that, she should work the word """"sexy"""" into the conversation at every opportunity. This gives off a very bad impression and leads to dating disaster when she falsely confesses that she thinks that Scrooge McDuck is sexy. In another scene Charlotte blurts out that Alice must have VD, but this could also be beneficial in counteracting her stuffy image. Chlo Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale shine in their respective roles, especially Chlo Sevigny, who since her debut in Kids has consistently been on the cutting edge of independent film, and has since crossed over to the mainstream after her Oscar nomination for Boys Don't Cry. Also worthy of mention in small but pivotal roles, Michael Weatherly was Hap, an ad agency client that Jimmy sneaked in through the back door. Michael Weatherly is now Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo (186 episodes, 2003-2011) in the popular TV show NCIS. Jaid Barrymore was the Disco Tiger Lady, who always appeared in jungle print fabric. This is Drew Barrymore's actual mother! Jennifer Beals, who was star Flashdancer by night/welder by day Alex Owens in Flashdance (1983) plays one of Des McGrath's disco discards. Brilliant stunt casting. Burr Steers, who played enforcer of the Disco's door policy and Des McGrath's nemesis, Van, is actually the nephew of both Jackie O. and Gore Vidal, as well as an ancestor of Aaron Burr, the man who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. His uncle Gore Vidal wrote a book of `historical fiction' entitled Burr, that focused on his nephew's namesake's role in the founding of our country. After playing Roger, AKA """"Flock of Seagulls"""" in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Steers went on to distinguish himself on the other side of the camera as a director of such films as 17 Again and Charlie St. Cloud, both with Zac Efron, and Igby Goes Down, starring Kieran Culkin. The bottom line is that The Last Days of Disco is an undiscovered gem of a film that sums up the good, the bad, and the ugly fashions of the Disco era and its demise. Tightly written and brimming with wit, Whit Stillman has created a brilliant film that combines the independent film spirit with young upwardly-mobile professionalism. The soundtrack contains all the great hits of that era, like """"He's the Greatest Dancer"""" by Sister Sledge, """"Shame"""" by Evelyn """"Champagne"""" King, """"Good Times,"""" """"Le Freak,"""" and """"Everybody Dance"""" by Chic, """"More, More, More (Pt. 1)"""" by Andrea True Connection, """"The Tide Is High"""" and """"Heart of Glass"""" by Blondie, """"I'm Coming Out"""" by Diana Ross, """"Got to Be Real"""" by Cheryl Lynn, """"Turn the Beat Around"""" by Vicki Sue Robinson, """"I Love the Nightlife (Disco 'Round)"""" by Alicia Bridges, """"Love Train"""" by The O'Jays, and even an acapella version of """"Amazing Grace"""" by a surprisingly good Kate Beckinsale. It all adds up to a great comedy of manners that is also an accurate historical document of an era that we can look back on with a mixture of nostalgia and relief now that it's over. Josh Neff sums it up thusly: ------------- Josh Neff: Disco will never be over. It will always live in our minds and hearts. Something like this, that was this big, and this important, and this great, will never die. Oh, for a few years - maybe many years - it'll be considered pass&eacute; and ridiculous. It will be misrepresented and caricatured and sneered at, or - worse - completely ignored. People will laugh about John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, white polyester suits and platform shoes and people going like *this* [strikes disco pose] Josh Neff: ,but we had nothing to do with those things and still loved disco. Those who didn't understand will never understand: disco was much more, and much better, than all that. Disco was too great, and too much fun, to be gone forever! It's got to come back someday. I just hope it will be in our own lifetimes. [Des, Charlotte, Dan, and Van stare at Josh like he's crazy] Josh Neff: ...Sorry, I've got a job interview this afternoon and I was just trying to get revved up, but... most of what I said, I, um... believe. ==================== <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Art-School-Confidential/dp/B000H6SXSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Art School Confidential</a>&nbsp;(2006) Matt Keeslar was Jonah <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Party-Monster/dp/B0016MJ6T2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Party Monster</a>&nbsp;(2003) Chlo Sevigny was Gitsie <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Laurel-Canyon/dp/B00009MEKN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Laurel Canyon</a>&nbsp;(2002) Kate Beckinsale was Alex <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Boys-Don-t-Cry/dp/B00003CWN3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Boys Don't Cry</a>&nbsp;(1999) Chlo Sevigny was Lana Tisdel <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/1558908242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Pulp Fiction</a>&nbsp;(1994) Burr Steers was Roger <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Much-Ado-About-Nothing/dp/B0000714BZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Much Ado About Nothing</a>&nbsp;(1993) Robert Sean Leonard was Claudio; Kate Beckinsale was Hero <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Swing-Kids/dp/B000065V3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Swing Kids</a>&nbsp;(1993) Robert Sean Leonard was Peter M&uuml;ller <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Metropolitan-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000C8Q9KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Metropolitan - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;(1990) Written, directed, and produced by Whit Stillman; Chris Eigeman was Nick Smith <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Flashdance/dp/B00005JKG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Flashdance</a>&nbsp;(1983) Jennifer Beals was Alex Owens <a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/Night-Shift/dp/B00000JGHP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">Night Shift</a>&nbsp;(1982) (as Ildiko Jaid) Jaid Barrymore was Joyce -------------------- Alice Kinnon: There's something really sexy about Scrooge McDuck. ============= Every actor is...is...great!

This ensemble cast was one of the first things I saw the stunning Kate Beckinsale in. She was great as the acidic Charlotte-so unlikable. It also stars Stilman regular Chris Eigeman and Chloe Sevigny in the impressive ensemble cast about the mating/dating rituals of yuppies in the early 80s. It is my third favorite Stillman film after Metropolitan (which also got the Criterion treatment) and Barcelona (which deserves the Criterion treatment). That being said it was better than I remember previously with the witty Stillman-esque dialogue including a hilarious take down of Lady and the Tramp. This DVD is a new restored high-definition transfer supervised and approved by Whit Stilman with audio commentary from Stillman, Sevigny and Eigman. Four deleted scenes with commentary. There's also an audio recording of Stillman reading a chapter from"""	Last Days of Disco The
7472	"Tells the story of Jesus Shuttlesworth  the most sought after high school basketball prospect in the nation. Jesus and his dream to make it to the big ranks in professional basketball are overshadowed by his father  Jake  who is spending his life in prison for killing Jesus' mother.Drama , basketball corruption father-son-relationship hip-hop jesus original redemption sports ,""Great I love Denzel Washington. I mean, I absolutely adore this man...he never gives a less than credible performance in any role he plays. Once again, he delivers as a less-than-perfect father in """"He Got Game"""". This is more than a story about basketball - it's about human relationships, the bond between a father and son, and how that prevails even in the worst of circumstances. The story, set in the Coney Island housing projects in Brooklyn, NY (where it was also filmed), surrounds Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel) who has been imprisoned in Attica for the accidental murder of his wife. His son, Jesus (Ray Allen), a high school basketball star who is being hotly pursued to either go into college or sign with the NBA, has nothing but contempt and disgust for his father. If Jake can convince his estranged son to attend a certain university and sign a letter of intent, then his time will be reduced significantly, since this school also happens to be the governor's alma mater. It starts off with a lot of promise, when Jake is allowed out of prison for a week to try to talk to his son. But after a while, the plot starts to wear thin when Jake keeps approaching Jesus, and Jesus is always telling Jake to leave him alone. How long can this be stretched out before you get tired of the whole thing? Okay, you can throw in flashbacks of Jesus as a child and how his father pushed him hard to play ball; a scheming, opportunistic girlfriend (Rosario Dawson); money-hungry friends and relatives; and plenty of tempting offers to either take money, sign with the NBA, go to this college and so forth to thicken the plot. Everyone seems to want something from Jesus, and as a result he has very little trust for anyone around him, and understandably so. But even that tends to get monotonous because you keep hearing the same type of dialogue, only from different characters. But stay with it. This movie does show realistic situations that face talented high-school prospects that can play basketball, so Spike was on point with this. However, it is not the first film that touched upon this subject. There was also """"Blue Chips"""" that had Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee (Penny) Hardaway in it as students/basketball players being heavily recruited for colleges and how they were being paid off, depending on what their decision would be. (At the time this movie was out, both Shaq and Penny were members of the Orlando Magic.) Ray Allen is an NBA basketball player in real life, but he is NO ACTOR, just like Shaq and Penny aren't actors, either. Whatever scenes Allen appeared in were kind of painful to watch because the man just has no skills in that area. He does try, though. And the rest of the cast aren't much better, most notably Milla Jovovich. She plays a grimy and pathetic prostitute who is repeatedly abused by her pimp. I found it difficult to believe that Denzel or any man would find her to be desirable. But then again, Denzel as Jake was just coming out of prison, so... I also disliked the fact that Spike had to throw in so many sex scenes. I normally enjoy Spike's films, but why must he exploit women? He makes them look like they are nothing more than lowlife sexual playthings who are out to use men for what they have. """"He Got Game"""" runs rampant with this, even casting porn star Heather Hunter in one of many (unnecessary) sex scenes! What the hell?! Although Spike does it on a smaller scale in his other movies, and always has, it didn't bother me as much as it did in this film. It was excessive. I understand the point that Spike was trying to make, but come on - couldn't he leave a little SOMETHING to the imagination? """"He Got Game"""" is definitely worth watching. Not perfect, but not a waste of time, either. See it! Spike Lee proves once again that he is a very talented director, and Denzel Washington delivers one of his greatest performances of all time. Ray Allen is not a great actor, but Denzel proves that he can carry any cast on his shoulders. I didn't pay attention to """"He Got Game"""" when it first came out, since I'm not a big basketball fan. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I did see it. I think it's one of Spike Lee's best movies. """"He Got Game"""" covers lots of issues: interracial dating, black stereotypes, the college athlete, corruption in college athletics, the politics behind sports, the incarceration of Black men, and most of all, a father trying to make amends with his son. """"He Got Game"""" is loaded with symbolism, each time you see it, you will pick up something new (the kids names: """"Mary"""" and """"Jesus""""; the last basketball shot, etc.). Most of all, I recommend this movie to you because I find it touching, and felt emotions that I certainly did not expect from a Spike Lee movie. My suggestion: see it for Father's Day! This movie probably could've been at least a little good if SPIKE LEE hadn't casted the NBA-player RAY ALLEN, he joins Dennis Rodman, Shaquille O'Neal & Rick Fox (who also is in the movie) in the list of BASKETBALL-PLAYERS who makes movies but can't act. Denzel does good work in the film YES but it takes more to make a good movie than one or two people in it who knows how to act (Hill Harper is the second one). Not a very moving story mainly becouse RAY ALLEN's and MILLA JOVOVIC's horrible acting. If you thought that rappers were bad actors, they are nothing against b-ball players. Any SPIKE LEE-movie is better than this one so skip it. Great movie, Denzel is silver screen royalty! I think this is Spike Lee's best. I've seen all his films and this is the only one I can watch over and over. Aside from most of his films this one doesn't seem to force a message. It also appeals to a larger audience than his other films. Didn't like. Maybe I already know too much about poor blacks and sports movies. If you like basketball films and realism, this movie's great. It's a Spike Lee film, and while it's not Do The Right Thing or Malcolm X, the directing is nothing short of great, and the father/son relationship in the film drives it and deepens as the film moves through the plot. Also, this film is not about a boy growing up, it's about a grown man making hard choices. It is very different from your normal, stereotypical teenager with basketball skills film. It's a nice ride, so sit back and enjoy! Great entertainment of vintage Spike Lee and Denzel Washington. Hard not to like this film. love it Good movie, overall. Great movie in great condition! realistic drama - D. Washington has a certain flair that promotes a large percentage of his movies !! Ray Allen is great. Denzel Washington and writer-director Spike Lee team for the third time with this contemporary basketball drama focusing on a promising athlete, the son of a convict-father entitled,He Got Game. It is sports-drama film written and directed Lee. It stars Washington as Jake Shuttlesworth, a prison inmate convicted for killing his wife. The father of the top- ranked basketball prospect in the country, Jesus Shuttlesworth,played by NBA star Ray Allen, Jake is released on parole for a week by the state's governor in order to persuade his son to play for the governor's alma mater in exchange for a heavily-reduced prison sentence. Jake Shuttlesworth has been in prison for six years when tough prison- warden Wyatt tells him that he's getting a temporary parole with the promise of a commuted sentence. However, there's a trade-off -- Jake must talk his son, Jesus Shuttlesworth, the top-ranked high-school basketball player in the country, into signing with the governor's alma mater, Big State. A flashback makes it clear that Jesus' mother was accidentally killed by Jake during a violent family fight. After Jake went to prison, the resentful Jesus was left alone to raise his sister Mary. Now several colleges are offering Jesus scholarships, and montages satirize the manner in which young athletes are wooed by educators and coaches across the country. However, Jake will soon be back behind bars if he can't get Jesus to sign with Big State within the week. Meanwhile, the greed of other family members begins to surface. The movie presents a realistic view on how athletes particularly basketball players are recruited by universities in their rosters. Aside from that,it also presents a vibrantly colorful father-son melodrama that would touch the viewers. Lee provides an artsy color film feature that was aided by great music from Aaron Copeland and Public Enemy. The story is moving especially when it becomes personal on both Jake and Jesus' part. The performances of Denzel Washington and Ray Allen,in his film debut,are also worthy to be mentioned. Overall,it may not be a great film but it is still worth your time especially for people who loves basketball. Although it's not my favourite Spike Lee Joint, """"He Got Game"""" is easily one of his best films, and it sure helps when you've got as many fine performances/cameos as this film does. Denzel Washington (who's incapable of giving a lousy performance) and Ray Allen as Jake and Jesus Shuttlesworth respectively, give the film it's anchors, allowing Lee to project his soapboxes and political rants more effectively than in earlier efforts such """"Malcolm X"""". It also helps to have Public Enemy back on board with a boomin' soundtrack (their best album in years), and other Spike Lee regulars Lonette McKee, Bill Nunn, and John Turturro--his cameo as a zealot college basketball coach is great. The story moves along briskly enough, isn't overdone, and the editing is as good as anything Oliver Stone chooses to claim as his own. A number of great quotes, and more than enough humour to lighten up the proceedings before they get too dark. Definitely worth owning. All Star Cast:Full Court Or Half Court, First Once To Eleven, First One To Score Makes The Rules Oh my brought me Back To The Day. ...He Got Game was not quite as good as I thought it should be. Denzel Washington was superb as always, as the jailed father of a basketball player, who is allowed out of jail to help convince his semi-estranged son to attend a certain university. Washington is convincing. His sexual escapades with the relatively untalented Milla Jovovich are not all that believable, although I guess if I had been in prison for so long I might consider Jovovich also. The real life basketball player who plays the basketball star who has to choose his path is all right. He is no actor, though, and his path to decisionmaking is pretty long and boring and there is just a bit too much sex in it. His conniving girlfriend Lala is trying to make him turn pro and is seeing agents on the side. She also has no qualms about not being loyal to him. Misdirected misfire, this film. It is a shame, but it did serve my immediate purposes. After producing mediocre stuff like Crooklyn and Bamboozled in the mid-1990s, Spike Lee rebounded strongly in 1998 with He Got Game. This was easily Lee's best film since Malcolm X in 1992. At first, moviegoers may be inclined to think that He Got Game will be little more than a slam-dunk fest that will showcase the athletic talent of its lead actor, Ray Allen (one of the NBA's premier players). Truth be told, however, He Got Game is more a sentimental drama than a sports movie, and the film focuses primarily on the behind-the-scenes pressures, temptations, and betrayals that often confront athletes as they are recruited"""	He Got Game

Today it's more evidence of Hollywood's and society's racial biases at the time it was made - two white actors portray the love interests, despite Maria's ethnicity in the storyline and the availibility of talented Hispanic actresses. Why wasn't Rita Moreno cast as Maria instead of Natalie Wood?? The story is rather childish for today, although the play will always be a classic. Okay for historical sense, but today's young people will see the flaws. The details were remarkable in this Blu-ray version. The following scenes illustrated this clarity. .

These included pores, blemishes, lines, wrinkles, moles, brown spots, pimples, and hair stubbles. One of my favorite musicals of all time. Seeing this in HD blu-ray on my flatscreen TV was a joy and 1/2. I couldn't get over how good it looked. Well done and the extras are nice as well. When this blu-ray was first released five years ago, it had a major glitch. This was noted and improved discs put out under a new UPC number. But I just bought a copy __with the UPC number for the corrected version__and the glitch is still there__five years later! The glitch involves the image fading to back and then fading back in again during the overture. I have no idea if Fox is still replacing defective discs, nor how they can insure a fixed disc is being sent if they are now sending out the defective ones under the serial number for the fixed version. Are they just trying to get rid of the faulty discs any way they can??? This is really bad business on Fox's part. Rating is for the disc, not the classic film. I originally saw this movies years ago, but enjoyed the bonus dvd showing the making of the film. At last I have a copy that isn't faulty .

Childhood memory favorite, it was wonderful to enjoy this again and it brought me back to my childhood with happy thoughts! A classic movie A Christmas movie that's all about toys? An old version of Toy Story? No. There's more to it than that! It's about Mother Goose Land, Where Mary Quite Contrary is about to be wed to Tom the Piper's son(who obviously has outgrown his pig-stealing habit). All is set for a happily ever after wedding,when in steps the villain, Snidley Whiplash style: Barnaby, the crooked, greedy banker. Only he knows that Mary will inherit""""scads of money""""when she marries, and is determined to marry her for her inheritance. The scoundrel has Tom kidnapped.....and the story takes off from there, leading the heroes through forbidding forests and on to Toyland for a final showdown between Barnaby and Tom and his army of toy soldiers. Spectcular stop-motion March of the Toys. Good movie for stop-motion movie fans. Starring Ray Bolger, Ed Wynn, Annette Funicello, Gene Sheldon, Tommy Sands, and Henry Calvin.(Remember the original Seargent Garcia?) DVD REVIEW This DVD release at the time of my review of this film adds nothing to the VHS. No Widescreen, no re-mastering, and no extras. I will keep my VHS copy for now. Now on to the original film itself: FILM REVIEW In this 1961 film, the first true live-action musical from the Walt Disney Studio, Tommy Sands is paired up with America's girl next door who got her start with Walt Disney, Annette Funicello. Also the famous Ray Bolger and Ed Wynn are featured, and Ann Jillian was a child actor in this movie. There is more great talent from the Disney in-house stable of stars, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, who played brothers in both """"Old Yeller"""" and """"Swiss Family Robinson"""". The story is simple enough, we are in Mother Goose land and the villain shrinks our heroes to toy size. They must enlist help from the toys in the Toymaker's shop to fight back. The effects were eye-popping at the time, and to see a toy army coming to life and fight the bad guys is a great treat for kids. The movie has some real fun stop motion style animation, where the toys are made to look like they are alive (30 years before computer animation did it for """"Toy Story""""). The Christmas parade at Disneyland has featured replicas of the marching soldiers from this film for over 40 years. The beautiful wooden toys that are seen in the film were all designed by veteran animator Ward Kimball. (animators X. Atencio and Bill Justice joined Ward on the stop-animation to bring the custom made toys to life). The movie was promoted in advance on the Walt Disney television show, in a 1961 episode that also promoted """"The Parent Trap"""", (the episode is called """"The Title Makers""""). The film was promoted again that year in an episode called """"Backstage Party"""", which celebrated the completion of the film and gave the viewers a tour of the Disney Studio. The sets specially built for the film at the studio were so unique, they found a temporary home at Disneyland after the films release in '61 up to 1963, and people could actually see them up close inside the Opera House on Main Street. The best part of this film is the music, which is the true star of any musical. The musical score features 11 songs from the in-house team of George Bruns (music) and Mel Leven (lyrics), and their score was nominated for an Academy Award. But even with the music, great stars, incredible sets, special effects, nice costumes, the script and dialogue left a lot to be desired so the film was deemed dull for adults. Uncle Walt hated the end product, but gamely tried to promote it as best he could and use it as an exercise for the studio to learn from, as he really wanted to make a good musical. Just 4 years later he released the studios biggest live-action film ever, a musical to beat all musicals, """"Mary Poppins"""". The lesson had worked. Watch Babes in Toyland with light expectations, see it for the toys, Annette and the gang, and enjoy the wonderful music. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE AS A YOUNG GIRL AND WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH MY CHILDREN was a gift Great movie thanks!! good movie loved this movie when I was younger. Make no mistake, this is not """"March Of The Wooden Soldiers"""", but it is a lot of fun for smaller children and the whole family. Decent music, lots of color and easy to follow story about Mother Goose characters. Annette Funicello was always cute to watch and Tommy Sands had his day in the sun. Fun to see the early Ann Jillian as Bo Peep singing. Ray Bolger played the evil Barnaby out to get rid of Tom Piper so that he could marry Mary Contrary and get her money. Fun to see Henry Calvin and Gene Shelton ( two alumni of the Disney Zorro TV series) as Barnaby's henchmen. You shouldn't expect more than entertaining musical numbers and colorful costumes, remember this was done for children and children of all ages enjoyed it. A childhood favorite. im completely satisfied with this order. Nice movie the kids liked it! :) an awesome little movie. took my daughter to see it on stage. purchased this for her daughter to enjoy Of all Annette Funicello's movies, this was her favorite. That's why it gets 5 stars. A curtain opens to reveal the Toyland set, helping to make the movie look even more artificial than it already does. It is based on an Operetta of the same name. Even in 1961, when this was released, operetta was pretty much dead as a doornail. My Mom is the only person I ever knew who liked Operetta. She hated this movie. Two of Disney's staff writers wrote new lyrics to Victor Herbert's music, further infuriating my Mother. In addition, neither Tommy Sands nor Annette had the voices required for operetta, so, all the music was pretty much lost. Annette, a natural brunette, was transformed into a redhead for this movie. Annette is lovely. Unfortunateley, she doesn't have a lot to do except cry a lot and often. It's remarkable that Annette is the actress most remembered for this movie. She received third billing in this, and yet, there she is on the cover, standing by herself between two toy soldiers. It's hard to believe, but Tommy Sands won out over James Darren for the part of Tom the Piper's son (Stole a pig and away he run.) Mr. Sands looked more like the guy who stole your hub caps. Still, he has a nice singing voice and he does what he can with the script he has been given. Top billed Ray Bolger is the evil Barnaby. Who could be expected to believe that? He does a nice job dancing with Annette while singing his solo """"Castle in Spain"""" (a love song in the original). Disney contract players Henry Calvin, Gene Sheldon, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran are here along with a very young Ann Jillian singing """"Never Mind Bo-Peep"""" and Broadway's Mary McCarty (One day to be Stella Deems in FOLLIES) is Mother Goose. The Disney Orchestra and Chorus are unmistakeably familiar. All of this gives the proceedings the feeling of a TV show. It doesn't have the look of a Major Studio Production. The sets, although pretty, look like cardboard and plastic. All in all, The Laurel and Hardy feature is a better movie and closer to the original in concept. The singing is by Charlotte Henry (Alice in Wonderland) and a boy who's name i cannot remember, but it is excellent. And, there's the super-scary bogie-men! who might be too much for the little ones. Still, there's only one Annette and this Disney version is much beloved by its fans. Watched this as a kid, now I have my kids hooked on it. We like the old Disney live action movies and were glad to find it. Hadn't seen this flick in over 50 years, when I was about 6. Guess what? It is BETTER as an adult! It's a loose remake of 'The March of the Wooden Soldiers"""" from the '30s with Laurel and Hardy, actually the Victor Herbert operetta, complete with Disney color and special effects and music. I thought it was magnificent, the best light fantasy since """"The Wizard of Oz."""" It absolutely refuses to take itself seriously, which is why it works so well. And did I mention that the great Ray Bolger, Oz' Scarecrow, played Barnaby the (not-so) Bad Guy? Top it off with Annette Funicello in her young and very pretty prime, a great supporting cast, and what's not to like? I think this movie is wonderfully delightful, it shows how talented Walt Disney was before all the trash was brought into the movies. A childhood epic. Today as a senior you might think this is hokey, but then the fond memories return. great-thanks First movie I went to the movies to see, still the same thanks. First off (no offense to anyone) I want to say I hate musicals with a passion except Willy Wonka. But I love this movie! The dancing it so neat and fun to watch and I love the way all the fairy tales are mixed in and I love the way it's just put together and also for a 60's movie that you can tell is just filmed on a stage with back drops has better special effects then movies today. Great movie!! Time tested good family entertainment. That is what Disney is all about. I used to watch this every Christmas on the Disney channel. I still like it. Old classic. Great condition. Thanks. If this 1961 Disney musical reminds you a bit of 1939's WIZARD OF OZ, that's hardly surprising. You got your fairy tale villages (well, Mother Goose,actually, but who's counting?): you've got spooky forests with trees that come alive and scare innocent children : and you've got Ray Bolger (this time as a bad guy, but still dancing up a storm when given a chance). There's even an Ed Wynn connection, sort of, since the lovable comedian, seen in here in a fairly small role, reportedly once rejected the title role in the '39 classic because it was """"way too small."""" I guess, 22 years on, he had learned his lesson. Apparently, both this version of BABES IN TOYLAND and the earlier Laurel and Hardy adaptation, took considerable liberties with the Victor Herbert stage play--to the point where you could say they were only loosely adapted on same. Since the source work is not really considered a classic itself, such revisions probably shouldn't matter much. Hollywood-izing (or """"Disney-izing"""") classic fairy tales or children's literature is one thing, submitting a turn-of-the-century operetta to the the same treatment should not upset purists too much. It is interesting to note, however, that by 1961, the thrust of the storyline had switched from a scheming uncle trying to rob children of their inheritance, to a Snidely Whiplash type villain out to force the beautiful, innocent young Mary (who despite her name and her cockle-shell full garden is anything but """"contrary""""--in general anyway , although she lets her contempt for the villain, Barnaby, show) into marriage so that he rob her of HER inheritance (and presumably other things as well). Of course"""	Babes in Toyland

Awful....and Diane Keaton looks rediculous Godfather 3 staring Al Pacino stars in the final chapter of the Godfather movies all 3 Godfather movies are classics . all are restored an uncut love the bluray.. One of the best movies ever made. We had to replace our VHS versions of this movie. Since we are big fans and play often I can say that the quality is good and we haven't had any problems with the quality. This is not an awful film but it just never reaches the magical heights of the first two films. Below are some of the reasons, in no particular order, that I believe cause this film to be such a let down: -Pacino is no longer Michael Corleone, he's just Pacino. -Its not a period piece so it lacks the detached romanticism of the previous two films. -The story in this installment just doesn't click. Consequently this is the only film in the series that seems to be twice as long as it should be. -Robert Duvall is not in the film. I'm not sure who's fault this really was but the issue needed to be resolved at all costs before filming began. -Winona Ryder bowed out for health reasons and was replaced by Coppola's novice of an actor daughter. -Joe Mantegna and Andy Garcia's characters seem like they belong in a second rate Godfather knockoff not an actual Godfather film. -They waited too long to make this film. A lot had changed in the 15 years between Part III and Part II and there just isn't enough visual continuity between the films. -The film needed some more great actors turning in Oscar worthy performances. The first two films had Brando, Caan, Cazale, Duvall, Strasberg and DeNiro turning in career defining roles. This one just does not have anyone of that caliber. Wanted Out...Was Pulled-In....was ok; had some great moments and the ending made me really cry terribly. Al P. too awesome I now have the complete series At first blush, this is the weakest of the trilogy. How do you follow up what may be the greatest movie of all time (certainly the penultimate mafia movia) and it's worth successor? The easy path would have been more of the same. Instead, we get the story of the Michael Corleone's attempt to run from the corruption. Interspersed we are shown, but not told, of how people follow their parent's destiny, and how mobsters should not be so glamorized after all. While many find it unworthy of the initial greatness, I found the dark irony an intriguing way to close the saga. This is a classic Item as described and good delivery time. Classic Nothing can beat Part 1 and Part 2. It's an ok movie it just doesn't have the story that the other Godfather movies did. I love it. My Man!! Great product I seen part 2 first,than 1,and lastly this one. Even though part 2 is my favorite,I felt this was a nice conclusion to Michael's story and how he just couldn't escape The Life completely. They were going to make a 4th film but Mario Puzzo passed away and all was off. Would've watched that too,but oh well,still satisfied. This is a classic! Godfather III is definitely the weakest link out of the godfather trilogy. It's not terrible but it's not nearly as good as its two predecessors. Why? This is the question that many people asked themselves before and after seeing Francis Ford Coppola's third (and hopefully last) installment of The Godfather saga. The first two parts were such perfect meditations on violence and the absolute corrupting effect of money and power on an individual. The way Part II ended was a darkly poetic conclusion that nothing else really needed to be said. Apparently, Coppola thought otherwise and went back to the well one more time with Part III. The problem is that he waited too long. Too many years had passed and he had changed as a filmmaker. Almost going mad making Apocalypse Now and the commercial and critical failure of The Cotton Club had taken its toll on the man. Hollywood had changed and this is reflected in the movie. First and foremost is the casting: Andy Garcia? Bridget Fonda? George Hamilton?! They are fine actors in their own right but are they really acceptable substitutes for the likes of James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall? Granted the first two played characters that died in Parts I and II but the miscasting of these actors speaks volumes of what is wrong with so many movies coming out of Hollywood these days. Actors are cast for their marquee value and not because they are necessarily right for the role. The Godfather Part III has the feeling of a paycheck movie because it lacks the passion of the first two parts. In the `90s, Coppola's generation of Movie Brats had fallen on hard times. Brian De Palma and William Friedkin had become hired guns with erratic track records. Steven Spielberg had become absorbed by the Hollywood system and Martin Scorsese remade Cape Fear. The Godfather Part III was Coppola's attempt to regain box office clout within Hollywood but instead he was crucified by critics for his troubles. First off: I loved Sofia Coppola in this movie. (Winona Ryder, who was originally cast but dropped out, probably realized that she was wrong for the part). But Sofia brings an authentic look and an authentic innocence to the role. She got toasted when this movie came out, and I thought it was really unfair. I'd also read that Paramount was too cheap to pay Robert Duvall to return as Tom Hagen, which is very unfortunate since the first two GODFATHER movies really didn't leave a lot of characters that could come back. Francis Coppola also said in an interview that Paramount approached him to write and direct GODFATHER III. He asked for six months to write the script. Paramount gave him six weeks. That, in a nutshell, is the problem with the film: it plays like a rough draft. And considering its cinematic lineage, that's really the ultimate shame: Coppola should've been the one to give them the deal they couldn't refuse. (I've always said that the real third film to this """"trilogy"""" is GOODFELLAS, which picks up with mob life in the 1950's--about the time THE GODFATHER II ends--and takes it into the 1980's). Godfather Part III is in no way comparable to the magnificant Parts I and II. Much of the acting is very sub-par, in complete contrast to the earlier Godfather films. Nor is the plot particularly compelling. Michael wants to exit the underworld, the rest would be telling. But what really characterizes this film is the poor acting. Even Al Pacino fails to turn in a compelling performance here. Very disappointing. I gave this one three stars because, well, it is still The Godfather, kind of. I considered two stars, which should tell you something. After seeing the reviews for this i was sceptical to say the least. But i watched anyway. Guys it's not that bad! Of course it's not as good as part one, or even part two, but i was as gripped as i was when i saw those two. What i will say is for everyone to take their heads out of their butts and stop expecting cinematic history every time, co guys if that was the case, then you'd have nothing to bitch about on here everyday. Not as bad as everyone says it is. Enjoy The movie, at nearly three hours, is simply too long. If it had been cut down by an hour it would have been better. It didn't have me interested for the whole three hours. The interest came and went. I thought Sofia Coppola was excellent in the role she was so maligned for, the role of Michael Corleone's daughter. She was utterly believable, and she wasn't the annoyingly picture perfect beauty queen that is usually seen in movies. Thanks for giving us a real person for a change. She looks great. The best thing about the Godfather series is the acting of Marlon Brando. His Don Vito Corleone is his finest work in a distinguished career, and it wins my award for best acting performance of all time by anyone. Without him, how can you compare Godfather Part 3 to the others? It's like taking Babe Ruth off the 1927 Yankees and then expecting them to be as good. We have kind of had enough of those mass killings of mobsters. It's been done before, no? Anyway, in much of the movie I really enjoyed the acting and the development of the story, and in other parts I felt my interest wane, until it picked up again. It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't sustain 3 hours and it really can't be compared to a Marlon Brando Godfather movie. horrible story trumped only by even worse acting.the bright star is the demise of sophia.''daddy?!?!?.............''...wtf...i can only assume francis had a ton of crack and wanted to see if he can direct a movie while tweakin.a pure and utter disgracefull way to end what could have been the greatest trilogy ever!!!!!!!WTFG FRANCIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!btw,give this another title and its still a pile of steaming mule droppings. On its own, """"The Godfather Part III"""" is actually a pretty good movie. However, in comparion to its two predecessors, I'm sorry but the film just doesn't hold its ground. Coppola and Puzzo were running out of ideas, and the cast members, both returning and new, basically phoned in their performances. The main problems with the film are script and casting. First of all, the plot is filled with more holes than Sonny Corleone's body when he got shot at the toll booth. Several new characters are introduced to the story, many of them with little to no origins that just pop out of nowhere. There is some weird plot against the Vatican that may have looked good on paper but just didn't transfer well onto the screen. Then, there's the cast. Pacino and Andy Garcia were great, but for the most part, the cast sleepwalked through their performances, including Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna were welcome additions to the cast but they too couldn't muster up decent performances. Whose idea was it to replace Robert Duvall with George Hamilton? What was Bridget Fonda doing there again? And then there's Sofia Coppola - look, Francis, we all know you love your daughter, but if you really loved her, you wouldn't go exploiting her lack of acting talent like you did with this film. The film is not a complete waste, however. The scenes from Sicily, for exmple, are brilliantly written and breathtakingly filmed. As an Italian, I can honestly say this is the best footage of the Sicillian landscape ever to be put on film. The usual death montage at the end of the film was cool to watch, and the Atlantic City Massacre sequence was incredibly well done. Overall, get this film only if you want to own the complete trilogy on dvd. Otherwise, just catch it on tv. The Godfather III has been one of the most maligned movies in recent times. The truth is the movie is not that bad. In the first two movies, as Michael Corleone descends into his pitiful existence, the audience sees Michael suffer for his terrible sins only once, when Kay aborts her child. However, we never see the guilt, remorse and sorrow that Michael exhibits in Godfather III. One of the criticisms leveled at this movie is that Michael does not die a violent death at the hands of his enemies. He suffers a far worse fate, as he sees his daughter die before his eyes.

I had this movie in VHS and could no longer use my VHS player and did not want to lose the movie powerful If you love war films, you have to have this one. very good movie with Tom Hanks and Matt Damon Item was as described. Would certainly purchase again if needed. My second copy . . . . wore out the first DVD. Just one of the best movies. EVER. Last week I watched Saving Private Ryan for perhaps the twentieth time since I first saw it in a theater back in 1998. Saving Private Ryan has always ranked at the very top of my overall Top 10 list of favorite war movies. Directed by Steven Spielberg, written by Robert Rodat, and starring Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Upton, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and others, Saving Private Ryan, is a tale about World War II. As the film opens, it is present-day, and an old man is seen walking through a military cemetery. He is searching for a specific grave. His family is with him. He finds the grave, and tearfully remembers a terrible, war-torn day from decades past: D-Day, June 6, 1944 On that day, the Allies have begun landing on the beaches in Normandy, France. Among those landing on Omaha Beach is a U.S. Army Ranger Captain named John Miller and his platoon of soldiers. After withstanding withering enemy fire at the beachhead, Miller and his men finally break through fierce and stubborn Nazi resistance. Soon afterward, they receive a new and dangerous special assignment. They must traverse enemy held territory, locate Private James Ryan somewhere behind enemy lines, notify him that all three of his brothers have been killed in action, and bring him off the battlefield, so he can return home to his grieving mother Saving Private Ryan features a tense, exciting, and surprisingly moving story. It begins and ends with two of the most violent and bloody battle scenes I have ever seen in a movie, and probably the most realistic. Yet, Saving Private Ryan is not just an overly simplistic action story about good GI's fighting bad Nazis. Screenwriter Robert Rodats beautifully drawn characters are all very human, with strengths and human frailties in equal measure. They dare to ask the question: why are we doing this? Somehow, they may be able to make a modicum of sense of why they are in the war, but this specific mission that they're now on remains incomprehensible to them. Yet they continue on, and they fight, and some of them die, so that one man can return in safety to his family I have watched many war films over the years, some good and some bad. Without question, Saving Private Ryan is the very best war film I have ever seen. It easily earns my highest recommendation. One of the best movies ever to watch for the family and for whoever wants to get this movie they will love it great movie, excellent screen play and awesome actors. the standard by which others are judged This might have to be the greatest war based movie i have ever seen. the D-day invasion scene was very detailed and absolutely amazing. Plus Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. Love this movie This movie show you went really went on in WWII. """"Saving Private Ryan"""" is a movie that is truly epic in scale and stars a huge array of big names, some of whom became even bigger after the film, (eg. Vin Diesel). The film opens with the harrowing D-Day landings, following Captain Miller and his men. The unit is given the mission of finding and getting Private James Ryan out of the war. His 3 brothers have all been killed and it has been decided that 3 or 4 sons is enough sacrifice for one mother to make. A lot of the depth of the movie comes with the relationships between Miller and those around him. There are some truly light hearted moments, such as the pool that is running to find out what Miller did before the war. However, a lot is very deep and touches on some issues that other movies seem to gloss over. One is a conversation in which Miller mentions that over 90 men have died under his command and the way in which he copes with that personally. The movie does not glorify war, but shows it in its hideous randomness and brutality. Though there a more violent films out there, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""""product-link-linked"""" class=""""a-link-normal"""" href=""""/We-Were-Soldiers-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000068TPN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"""">We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)</a>, """"Saving Private Ryan"""" definitely does not gloss over anything. This is a profoundly moving movie, and one that I have seen more than once. Every viewing is moving. It is simply a great story, well-acted, well-directed and engrossing. For far too long, war movies have glamorized an otherwise horrific act... warfare. The reality is it's frightening. It's random. It's uncertain. it's chaotic. It's frantic. It's maddening. It makes men out of boys and turns grown men into crying babies. Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon and a host of other actors add to an ensemble cast that appear onscreen as if hardened by years of """"The Great War."""" War has never been so realistic. Tom Hanks in this Military WWII Historic Drama is spectacular. A Must have for the favorite shelf. Very well done movie. A Must Buy ! This has to be the best most genuine war film ever made. No stops on the true horror of battle and men uniting for a real cause. Great flick. War films can be broken into two basic categories; the propaganda film, which celebrates bravery and patriotism; and the anti-war film, which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a post-war environment. An exception to this war-in-progress concept was is """"Saving Private Ryan"""". Cloaked in an anti-war facade, this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 (its setting) than 1998 (its year of release). Under its thin anti-war facade of realistic looking destruction, Private Ryan breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an anti-war work. Almost by definition anti-war films use a faceless enemy (""""Paths of Glory"""") or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war (""""The Enemy Below""""). Often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them (""""The Longest Day""""). This is because after a war, both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined, otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating. Not so in Private Ryan; if the German battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced, a single allied division could have occupied all of Germany by the end of June 1944. The final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how, facing such a totally inept enemy, the war could have gone on more than a few days after the D-Day Landings. Then again, what do I know? I'm only an inner child. I remember seeing this film in the theater when it first came out in 1998. I was stunned by how realistic it was, and up to that point I had never seen anything like it. The cinematography makes you feel like you are there, in Normandy, with the troops. 'Saving Private Ryan' raised the stakes enormously in regards to war films. In my opinion, it immediately became the benchmark that future war films would be compared to. To this day, I tend to subconsciously compare any new war film I watch to this masterpiece. Much to the dismay of some of the reviewers here, SPR is actually....gasp....patriotic! It actually has the nerve to portray American soldiers as honorable and the war as a just cause. This is not to say that they are portrayed as saints or fearless heroes. This is no John Wayne movie. The characters are men with flaws and weaknesses just like everyone else, and this gives the film a very realistic feel. Sure, the plot is fictitious and it's a little over-sentimental, but as far as I'm concerned, 'Saving Private Ryan' remains THE classic war film that stands above the rest. The negative reviewers just don't get it. 'Saving Private Ryan' is not a documentary nor does it claim to be. It is a tribute to the American soldiers who fought and died in WW2, period. If you want to see the British or the French, there are plenty of other films and documentaries out there to accomodate you. If you want to see an """"anti-war"""" film, or some profound, intellectual insight into the human condition, look elsewhere. If you're a bitter, cynical, nit-picker, you probably won't like 'Saving Private Ryan.' But if you want to see a patriotic, yet realistic film about World War 2, look no further.

I like how it is blue from every side, suggesting the depth of an ocean. Thank You Perfect for the kiddos, they loved it! I thought that they were Disney but they are not. They are still good movies but the image quality could be better. What a great way to see a lot of movies all at once! These DVD packages are great for parents to get gifts for their children and they like a variety to choose from. thanks for the tape but the two disc was different that what it said on the tape, the first disc was pocahontas, sleeping beauty, snow white, thumbelina, little mermaid, alice in wonderland, beauty and the beast, cinderella, but the 8 film collection animated said little mermaid, cinderella, alice and wonderland, beauty and the beast, the hunchback of notre dame, leo the lion, alladdin, and pinochhio that is what the paper said on the front so there was a different dics, thats all i can say, if you want a photo i can send u one. thank you. I have been looking for this movie on dvd for a very long time! I am so happy to have finally found it! :) Its a cute movie, did not get the interest of my 6 yr old though. But we will try again. I do not know why the previous copy I'd purchased on this DVD was different than this one. This has the same DVD cover as the previous copy I'd purchased, but the enclosed DVD is different. This is mostly the same movie I remember being traumatized by as a child haha. My sister and I wanted the Disney mermaid and my parents bought this in the budget VHS bin at WalMart... do NOT buy this expecting anything cheerful like the Disney title. I grew to really love this movie as a child and am glad to have it back in my life. My niece that is 5 yrs. old loved the DVD even though she did not understand the language, but I translated it. okay I received my dvds and none of them work. I tried 3 different DVD players and all got the same error and they didn't support that type of DVD. I tried a new DVD player and 2 older ones. So I contacted the seller and they said they would give me a refund but that I had to pay for return shipping. I don't think it's fair that their product was defective and didn't work and I have to pay to send it back. So when I went to the post office to send it back it was going to cost almost $10 more than I paid for it to send it back to them (because it's Canada)so basically I'm stuck with DVDs that don't work that are going to go in the trash. Huge waste! Go to a different seller! My favorite Little Mermaid movie was only the original 1989 release, but if the little ones in your household cannot get enough of her then buying this set saves money than getting all 3 movies seperately. It is also a great buy for the hardcore Disney fans young and old alike. It includes a trio of sealed (have not opened mine) mini lithographs depicting a scene/theme from each movie: The Little Mermaid, The Little Mermaid Ariel's Beginning and The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea. I purchased this DVD set as a gift for my 2 yr old niece who enjoys the THE LITTLE MERMAID,however I just can't get her to watch the other 2 movies in this package but either than that,it was a good deal for this DVD set! I have LOVED The Little Mermaid sense I was a little girl. When new Little Mermaids came out, I had to get them! I had a daughter that when this movie first came out she would watch it so much she actually wore out the VHS! Now she has children and we have purchased again on DVD. The Girls adore the story. But then who doesn't like Disney movies? The man was genius. Disney touches the heart of all young or old. movie is wonderful. plays like it is brand new. would never know it was used. had insert and everything, grand children love these movies seller had a great price and it arrived on time Darling. Colors, animation well done. A cute fairytale. Great..super fast delivery! Each movie was for my quadraplegic daughter and she has had many hours of enjoyment from them. They were shipped as promised and most arrived earlier than advertised and in excellent shape . She said to tell you all """"Thank You"""" It was a gift great movie Had no problems playing this in a samsung and sony bd player. I was unable to find this thing in best buy or at any disney store, so i am glad my daughter will be able to watch this movie now. Video looks like crap compared to movies like finding dory, but its good enough for my 2 year old to stay entertained. Im not sure if it was any better when i saw this in theaters 20+ years ago Cool I love bragging about this movie that I grew up on since everyone seems to think the Disney Ariel is the original. Both versions r great. One is jolly&other other is a bit sad with mermaid turning into foam at the end""""sorry to kill the end for you,but if your getting it for an extra sensitive small child it might not work out. The whole movie is great though&the music is unforgettable. I play it for my 4yr old whom love this movie- I assume eventually our movie will be scratched then I will end up re ordering:) This one is prettier and better than Walt Disney's Little Mermaid. The story is true to the original Christian Anderson's story and shows lots of morals and ethics contrary to the Disney version she can do whatever she wants and still get away with it. The Little Mermaid {UK Import: Region Free} Blu-Ray has been in my cart with much hesitation. I can either spend $60+ on the version locked up in the Disney Vault or buy this. Its simply a Choose Your Own Adventure book, I thought? Will it work on my X-Box One? So many questions, despite the items description. I bought it and with much success it works like a charm. The disk works on all Blu Ray players (including your gaming systems) ... Theres no digital copy or DVD included. For me thats okay! Great! My daughter loves this movie. She was very happy to receive this. nice movie A happy children's film from Walt Disney. One of my granddaughter's favorites. Mermaids are sirens, sing to lure humans to they death. Her dad is Poseidon. He raped Medusa before she was turned into a Gorgon by Athena. He also is the storm god, causes hurricanes and such. The film which started a whole new genre of Disney """"Classics"""" is just as entertaining now as when it first came out in theaters. Definitely worth the investment!! Does not play ...not even one quality was amazing My baby's first Disney movie Loved the movie Great my favorite movie of all time!!! Such a classic. Kids love it. Great gift good good. great movie I had one of the songs from this movie stuck in my head. I had to buy it! Still a winner in my book. I haven't seen it in 20+ years and still thought it was well done. Enjoy it very much i hesitated on buying this or seeing the last one, sure it couldn't be as good as the others. But I was glad to be wrong, the final/first story IS was well done as the other two. I'm well over 21 and still enjoy this set very much, kids love it too! Be sure to check the """"Region 2"""" reference. Thank you for the return. Thanks all is great DOES NOT WORK FOR US PLAYERS! MUST HAVE A UK OR MULTI REGION PLAYER! RUINED A CHRISTMAS PLAYER. Came quickly. Packaging was in perfect shape. 3 movies for the price of 1 is great! I love the old classics. I grew up on these then my daughter did too! Thank you for making these! Thank you for sending them to me! donated to church group so do not have any feed back was not what I though was but ok It was a very good deal for what I spent! good very nice it was a good family gathering when we watched few of this package movies , kids loved it , thanks Super way to introduce grandkids or young ones to many of the classics. gift I very nice Blu-ray steelbook and has raised outer-framed edge. The blue is much brighter to the eye than photo shown. The movie it self is one of my family's favorites. My eldest daughter watched The Little Mermaid Blu-ray with her 5 year old son, and he loves it as well. In my opinion The Little Mermaid will go down in herstory as one of Disney's finest, as well as Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Lady and the Tramp, Bambi, Robin Hood, Sword in the Stone, Beauty and the Beast, and my favorite, Finding Nemo. Great family movie! Excellent movies!!! These disc were terrible. Had to strip and rip them to ISO files to get the movies to play properly. Must have been bootlegs. Excited to see the prequel part of this dvd! good I love 3D Great price, love the movies, mine came with a diamond edition one, the whole thing was sealed I grew up watching Disney movies and I have to say that I like these much better. They send a better message to my kids and don't cost $20-$30 for each movie. The kids love these movies and I don't mind watching them either so it's a win/win. Great, granddaughter loves it. This is the best deal in obtaining all three parts of the movie at a reasonable price. If you are going to get one, and you know they will want two -- and then the last one (regardless of the latter two's quality), you definitely get your money's worth buying the three as a set than separately. Simple as that. Always loved the original version (by Disney) and always will. Good price good and fast service. Our grand daughter loves all three movies. Would recommend vendor and will use again. I've always loved this movie since I was a little girl. a gift love it The picture is very fuzzy. Very poorly made. Not as described I should have looked at the picture better. I read the description that said """"Collectible Classics"""" and assumed that meant they were the Disney version. Especially since the titles were the same as the Disney versions. I have not actually played this for my kids since it was not the Disney version, but with it only being $5, its not worth it to return. I'm sure the kids will eventually watch it. A gift for my niece. I love this movie so much that I had to buy it on Blu Ray. It's that good for me. The disc art for the Italian Blu Ray release of The Little Mermaid (Diamond Edition) does have artwork just like on the sleeve cover, plus it's not region coded so it worked very well on my NTSC Blu Ray Player, the feature film and all bonus features to my NTSC HDTV. Grandaughter hooked on classic fairy tales. Hard to find collections. Real Disney is unaffordable This version of the classic Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale was produced by Diane Eskenazi and distributed by the unpopular GoodTimes Entertainment studio.

Kaffee is known as being lazy and had arranged for a plea bargain. Downey's Aunt Ginny appoints Cmdr. Galloway to represent him. Also on the legal staff is LTJG Sam Weinberg. The team rounds up many facts and Kaffee is discovering that he is really cut out for trial work. The defense is originally based upon the fact that PFC Santiago  the victim  was given a """"CODE RED"""". Santiago was basically a screw up. At Gitmo  screw ups aren't tolerated. Especially by Col. Nathan Jessup. In Cuba  Jessup and two senior officers try to give all the help they can  but Kaffee knows something's fishy.

Jerry Maguire is also a very good movie if you haven't seen either of these movies I would highly recommend this double feature DVD. This package contains two really good movies. I have not seen Jerry Maguire for two years but I will watch it for the 3rd time this month. A few good men is also really good and I just watched it a couple of months ago for the second time. Both movies are well made and have great plots and have great acting. They both are suspenseful, and pretty believable. The tone of Jerry Maguire is reality and I guess so is the tone in A Few Good Men. I rate both movies 41/2 stars but combined they deserve a 5 star rating for the package. Tom Cruise is good in both. I cannot say much bad about either just good. ordered awhile ago came before time nice outer cover, if insides are as good as outside..great job I have enjoyed these movies several times since its arrival. Great condition! I am a fan of Tom Cruise, so what could go wrong?!! I had seen this movie several times so I jumped on the chance to own it.

Always good acting. Robert De Niro and Jason Stratham put this pair together and you have to expect one dynamite movie I have to say. Ronin never let me down for a spy flick it happens to be one of the best that I have seen. Tons of action and an unexpected was a chase scene watching Robert De Niro driving the wrong way in France or Italy in narrow streets and believe it will keep you on the edge of your seats like it did me. The mojo was there and it had me hyped so take my word and give it a try, you will not be disappointed. okay There is a lot of action that keeps the 'story' moving. Not much for deep thinking or story line, but fun none the less. It was jusy an overall great movie. If you can get through the first 20 minutes, story line and action ensues. The story was disjointed and the plot too contorted to be easily followed. Action packed but not a great storyline. Some outrageous car chases. This post cold-war story is thrilling and entrapping. DeNiro is his usual outstanding self. The remainder of the cast is outstanding, and you will recognize them from other movies. There are sudden twists and turns in the plot which holds your interest in what is otherwise a somewhat lengthy film. The car chase scenes are equal to, if not better than, those from The French Connection. Truly worth watching. Hey it's Robert DeNiro and Jean Reno; what more do you want.....oh and plenty of gratuitous violence and car chases. This a great movie I was browsing around for holiday shopping and saw I purchased this back in 2010 but never reviewed it. If you have never seen this movie, you've probably heard about the car chase. It's spectacular! So is the action, and so are the performances from a very solid cast of actors. This is an action/thriller that most guys should have in their collection, so it's a great buy or a great gift. It's also good enough that it's date-movie friendly for a night in. Every movie with an action scene tries to hype their action - this movie has the action that got others to hype it. Good movie! Love Robert De Niro, however, didn't like this movie ... it was slow. Modern classic-- impeccably shot I really do enjoy it, every time I see it, and pick out new little details I missed the time before. Excellent cast, great tempo for an otherwise intricate plot. Highly recommend to anyone that enjoys spy thrillers, for sure. In fact, I forgot it already. Overall good movie. Ending was a little predictable, but I really liked how each character developed. Great movie Interesting movie. Did not like ending. I saw this a long time ago. I enjoyed it then and I enjoyed it this time. Lots of action, but quite a bit of thought in the scenes. Really good - action packed - and the story was well told. De Niro is really good. Enjoyed this movie. I first saw the movie """"Ronin"""" over ten years ago; and to this day, I don't think a better spy movie has ever been made. Everything in the film just fits and works together to make this an extremely watchable movie. Interestingly, it's able to do this without the dynamic fight scenes that are a staple of many of the genre's films these days (although the car chases wouldn't look out of place at all in one of the more recent Bond films or in a Bourne movie). Whether by design, chance or both, everything (cast, dialogue, story, etc.) just works together to make a movie that is just right in its composition. It's not too much and not too little in almost every way. The end result is a classic spy film. Highly recommended. A karate person has the stance of a martial artist and that is the stance that Sean Bean has in this film as """"Spence"""" who is a vital part of the """"hit"""" team, he is the weapons specialist, he is calm, says nothing, stays alone, and is questioned by the other members of the team if he is a """"real"""" guns specialist, and does not belong to SAS. Spense does not take kindly to the choice of weapons that they would like him th use,and he does another weapon hidden in his coat pocket, he knows that he is being set up, and does what is called """"protect"""" the other members of the team. He leaves silently the next day paid off. He is a character that you have questions about. Its Sean Bean as a terrorist, and rogue samurai, one who peddles his skills for hire, and then moves on to another job. Its Spence the way he should be played. Calm, professional and yes, he is real, he is not a """"fake"""" which is what the other members of the team want him to admit. Its an intense role for Sean to play, its a very serious role, and its too brief. He does his job with the stance of a martial artist, meets his opponents, and then is released as a team member. He is a man who works well alone, his character needs to live by his wits, and alone, and that is what you do not see him do in Ronin. You see him question the authority of the other team members. Its Sean Bean at his best, and yes it you would like to find out more about Sean, I have the Sean Bean Club on Yahoo, and yes we have been on the net for a little while, but we run an immaculate club, because Yahoo has children on the clubs as well as adults. Ronin is not for some viewers, but if you like DeNiro and Bean together you will enjoy this film! In ancient Japan, a ronin was a samurai warrior whose master had been killed in disgrace. When this happened, the ronin lost his reason for being a soldier and often began a career as a hired assassin or mercenary. This bit of history acts as a metaphor for the characters in the film, Ronin. Robert de Niro is Sam, a middle-aged former CIA agent who, claiming to be broke, takes a job with a mysterious group in France. In Paris he meets the rest of the team. They include Vincent [Jean Reno], an ex French espionage agent, and Diedre [Natascha McElhone], who is in charge of the group and who was probably a major player in the IRA. The mission is to steal a package from another group, which is apparently manned with other former agents. The metaphor quickly begins to unfold. Like those ancient ronins, these people were fighters in causes that have ceased to exist. The difference is that their masters were political ones. They now double-cross and double deal for no noble purpose. In true thriller style, neither we nor the gang members are privy to the contents of this package. The contents become almost beside the point, as we watch these cynical, disenchanted characters chase after something they are willing to kill for. It's what they were trained to do, and that's what they do, even now that their reasons are vague, if not nonexistent. There are many good things about Ronin. I do not entirely agree with the general critical consensus that this is a grand return to days of stylish, inventive movie thrillers. True, there is no reliance on computerized special effects. It does contain two of the most spectacular car chases ever put on film. De Niro, as can be expected, is head and shoulders above the average modern anti-hero. But hasn't he always been better? Currently, as shown by him in Wag the Dog, Jackie Brown and this movie, he is in his deeply cynical phase. Expect him to mellow out in a few years. It is great to see 69-year old director John Frankenheimer back in the genre that made him famous. Two of his movies, The Manchurian Candidate [1962] and Seconds [1966], are two of the greatest thrillers ever made. But Ronin, while retaining essence of his earlier work, displays some unpleasant modern traits. Traditionally, the great car chases, as well as those on foot, have taken place in crowded cities or on busy highways. This heightens the suspense. The prototype of the modern chase was created in a brilliant 1969 film called Bullet. In it, cars careened around in a most spectacular setting - the streets of San Francisco. The ones in Ronin take place in the twisting streets of European cities, but unlike their predecessors, Ronin's characters manage to kill a number of innocent bystanders in the process. In real life, that's exactly what would happen, but this realistic approach backfires. I was disturbed by the fact that none of these deaths were ever referred to either in the film or by anyone I know who saw it. Movies about morally corrupt characters are acceptable, but it seems to me that some film makers today assume the audience is also corrupt. Surely, that's a fallacy on their part. Ronin, directed by John Frankenheimer, may not be his best movie, but it still delivers the action that most people today would want in a movie like this. Ronin's plot is very simple. It's basically about a group of mercenaries that are being paid to find a case. That's about it. There are many plot twists and turns as the loyalty of some of the mercenaries turns from good to bad. The action is well filmed. There are 2 very exciting car chases and numerous shootouts throughout the movie. There is also a lot of different cities and towns (all in France) that the mercenaries travel to. So by the end of the movie, it'll feel like you've just watched a huge 3-hour epic when you've only watched a 2-hour movie. The acting is great. Robert DeNiro, Jean Reno, Jonathan Pryce, Stellan Skarsgard, and Sean Bean all give outstanding performances. The DVD is OK. It has a nice commentary by John Frankenheimer, an alternate ending, (which isn't that different from the original ending.) and a little booklet that chronicles the making of the film. It also comes in widescreen AND fullscreen formats. All in all, it's a pretty good action movie with great action sequences/car chases and breathtaking cinematography, but the plot falls short. Even the pretty good acting can't save that. 1998; 121 minutes; Rated R for intense scenes of action/violence and strong language. Tense male bonding picture with chick sub-plot. DVD is okay, but could have had some more extras. Film itself is a sharp transfer and the commentary by John Frankenheimer is pretty good. The ease at which DeNiro slips between speaking French and English makes the film believeable. A top notch film with a solid cast. May be too intense for some, but still a take no prisoners movie. Chase scene through Paris is a bit reminiscent of the one in To Live and Die in LA but still well done...unless the Princess Diana parallels bother you. Put this on, pop open a cool one sit back for a wild ride. Fantastic film! Very intense and I love the characters. I would highly recommend this film! Excellent movie! Excellent movie One of the hard things to believe about this movie is that an undercover CIA agent, played by Deniro, will actually go through surgery, having a bullet removed, by an amatuer in order not to blow his cover. This would never happen in real life. Also, the alternate ending on the DVD did not make much sense to me. This has all of the cliche's of all action movies, long car chase scenes, guns shooting, and the mysterious betrayals left and right, not knowing who"""	Ronin

Don't take that the wrong way, I loved the movie, I think Johnny is awsome, but the story is just flat out depressing (not that I was thinking/hoping for kittens, rainbows, and horses mind you, this is afterall a Burton project). I did thuroughly enjoy it though, it truely is a great little classic Burton film in all apspects of those words. If you've never seen it, I suggest you do especially if you are a big Burton fan. You WILL NOT be dissapointed, sad for the outcome may be but not with this movie. It's a definite keeper. :) I think this is a good movie that i had ever seen. If you haven't seen it you got to see it. I like the part when Eward got stuck in the house when the alarm was going off and when he was cutting the hair. This is one of my favorite movies. Johnny Depp is great as Edward. The movie gets very funny at some times. Especialy when all the neighbors wanted Edward to give their dogs, haircuts. The end is creepy, exciting and a bit sad. I would highly recomend this movie. best movie ever A real masterpiece Very original. One of Tim Burton's best films. Frankenstein meets the Avon lady with a big bucket of the absurd... add some Dr. Seuss and Disney and mash up with some Poe and Roald Dahl... and there goes the essence of Tim Burton. Mixture of many contrasting things and yet still so wholly original. I love this guy! Great cast of characters here. If I could change anything it'd probably be Winona Ryder's terrible bleach job here... ack. What an injustice to her dark yet doe-eyed beauty. I wish they'd given her black hair instead. Still fun to watch after all these years! There's something about this movie that is truly magical. It could be the music or the sense of wonder that it evokes, but every once in a while I feel the need to watch it. This is a classic, a must-see for everyone. Love around Christmas. Edward Scissorhands is a fantastic film, and in a way that's very rare: it manages to be so many different things at once that it's really impossible to classify it. Part fantasy, part fable, part drama, and part satire, it's a spectacularly done movie. A very imaginative story; it's also very funny in many parts. Also simply beautiful to look at - the use of style, color, and direction is astounding. I find myself putting in this bluray allot. I can watch it all the time, it really never gets old, definitely a classic... I recommend to anyone super classic movie Loved this film from start to finish. There are no words to describe Depp's character. classic and great Comes in an awesome tin. Great movie! Still love it after all these years. Johnny Depp is a Genius always one of my favs Grand daughter had never seen it. She was fascinated. I'm remember that movie 'Edward Scissorshand' came out when I was a kid, my first time seen it on cable television. I love it so much. I seen the 25 anniversary special edition on Blu-ray a must buy. Good flick. My teens love it! It's a classic! An amazing thing that Tony managed to do. Beautiful film. However--as many have already praised this, I needn't. The reason this will and has touched so many people is because who among us have not felt like the only """"strange"""" one in a white--bread society at some time? Burton and Depp lay bare that longing, that need, while showing us that even the outcasts need not conform, as they are perfect in and of themselves. however, if we live as outcasts, there will be many people out to kill us because we are not the 'safe' ie boring and """"normal"""" creatures they think they are. Beautiful, beautiful film. Makes you think. Do. This has to be the one of most favorite and memorable movies of all from Tim Burton. The move itself, is brillant. Edward Sissorhands is about a man with sissors as hands, that lives on top of a mountain. The music in this film is great. Johnny Depp plays an incredible performance on Edward Sissorhands. There's just so much about this movie that is beutiful. I loved it a whole lot. It's just one of those movies that we can only remember by our hearts. An excellent story. If you haven't seen Edward Sissorhands, you've just gotta see this wonderful, imagitive movie. Trust me, it's a movie you'll always remember. Edward Scissorhands appears (on the surface) to be a fairytale that as many reviewers have written describes what it's like to be an outsider. Well that's only part of the story. The film is a masterful social commentary about racism and how it affects its victims. If you notice all of the characters are white and all of the houses appear colorful. Yet Edward is dressed entirely in black, lives in a dark castle and most poignantly his entire demeanor is in stark contrast to the films other characters. Edward is quiet and shy while all the other characters are brash and often borish. Yet when he does speak his words reflect deep introspection and caring. None of this is to say that this is how blacks are perceived today in a predominately white society but merely to illustrate the contrast between the two apparently different worlds. As the film unfolds however Edward's humanity is revealed. Of course that humanity is already apparent to Dianne Weist and Alan Arkin but they are the only characters who have genuine feeling for Edward. The other characters only view him as a curiosity without seeing the real person inside. Edward yearns to be 'normal' like everyone else. What he doesn't realize though is that he is the greater creature and that others should endeavor to be more like him. He sees the beauty in that 'other' world but no matter how hard he tries he just isn't accepted. In the end he is driven to violence and ultimately forced to retreat into his own world but not because of his own inadequacies but because society just won't accept him for what he is. Tim Burton is to be commended for crafting a film that teaches fundamental lessons about humanity and what american society does to many of its' 'citizens' who fall outside of the mainstream. His true genius is that no reviewer yet has really seen the film for what it really is yet the majority recognize and are moved by its fundamental truths. Really cute movie I used to be obsessed with Tim Burton movies, and that has been passed down to my youngest son, who is 6. He loves everything Tim Burton. He has almost all the movies. All was good Can watch this movie over and over again. Johnny Depp delivers a very convincing and perfect performance and you get very involved with Edward Scissorhands. Love this movie. Edward Scissorhands had a profound emotional impact on me. I think because I was able to identify with the main character of Edward, a half human half Frankenstein robot with hedge clippers for hands. While I don't have quite so drastic a story, I was born with cerebral palsy and use a wheelchair on a daily basis. This and my own sheltered nature has made it pretty challenging to make friends over the years. Because of all this, I really felt something of a kinship with Edward. In the span of approx. two hours, Edward goes from mysterious to the talk of the town to some type of dangerous half human. He is betrayed by people he trusts and is used for his unique skills. I have sometimes felt this way myself, so I can relate. I definitely understand being shy and sensitive like Edward grasping for understanding from a world that cant seem to understand. Hopefully I won't be driven into my own version of a house on a hill. A deeply meaningful movie. When I heard that this film was coming out on DVD for its 10th Anniversary, I was overjoyed. This is probably Tim Burton's best film to date- IMO. And with a stellar cast- Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Alan Arkin, Kathy Baker, and of course, Vincent Price- how can you go wrong? The story is fantastic, brilliantly acted out by all the cast. Such an innocent person introduced into a world of such bad things. Of course they except him, but when he does something that is not his fault, they immediately disregard him. As for the DVD extras, well, when I first heard about this DVD, I thought that it would be loaded with them. Apparently not. The two commentaries by Danny Elfman and Tim Burton are great, but unfortunately, from there it goes downhill. I expected much more concept art than is shown, as is the case with the featurette. Basically all that is, is the stars answering a few questions. I expected an half hour program and was looking forward to seeing some info on how the hands were made. The Soundbites could have been put into the featurette to have made it longer, but trailers and TV spots were a cool- always a welcome sight The only reason I have not given it five stars, is because of the disappointment in the extras. IMO, it would have been nice to have had """"Vincent"""" in there as well. This movie would had bin nothing without Vincent Price as the creator of Edward scissorhand(s). He's the one the that makes this into a real fearytale. A classic FAMILY horror/comedy starring Johnny Depp. But the big boost to this movie is the late horror master Vincent Price in his last performance before his death. Easily one of the 5 best horror icons of all time Price is superb in this movie. grandaugter loves it My daughter and I love this movie. We have so many laughs when we watch this movie. i was excited to find it here on Amazon. This was the film that, for me, marked Tim Burtons leap from very talented young director, to one of the best most unique film voices of our time, along with Johnny Depps leap from very talented young actor to one of our best actors, period. What Depp and Burton seem to share is an understanding of the visual power of film, but not just with cinematography and effects, but in performance. Depp is almost like a great silent film star, communicating more with his eyes, than most actors could with a monologue. This is the surreal fable of a young man who was built, not born, and whose creator dies before he can finish him, leaving him alone, with scissors for hands. Hes found and adopted by a sweet, if slightly daffy Avon lady Diane Weist in another of an endless series of brilliant supporting performances. She takes young orphan Edward down from the near black and white castle in which the lives to the bright pastel world of the suburban town below. (A world almost as surreal in its exaggerated way as his lonely castle. There the outcast finds a place, and maybe even love, but is there really room for the truly different in our society? A film in which everything is bigger than life, but infused with heart and the bitter-sweetness of life itself. It brings a smile to my face, and tears to my eyes on every viewing. Love this movie. The concept of holiday films as become a cliche over the years and one I've grown long tired of. Holiday films peeked in 1990 with two of the best and most drasticly different of their gere.

This is a serious movie about death -- very interesting, very different. Robin William was great in the movie. A little disappointing One of his best, but hard to watch twice. Mostly due to the nature of the film especially among those that had to deal with depression. The acting is top notch and the visuals are amazing. Don't be surprised if your crying by the end. Beautiful movie. Anything that Robin does is fantastic A very intense and thought-provoking movie! In many ways, the movie was optimistic about the afterlife. I'm glad that I bought the movie! Robin Williams performs an epic role to discover the ever after and brings to life both heaven and he'll. Exquisite. Will need Kleenex! A lovely story of two people who are soul mates suffering major losses and are reunited by the power of their love This film gives you something to think about could heaven really be like this as well as hell, for someone that may not be sure of where they will spent eternty this is a nice film to get them to give it some thought. This movie has really good visual effects and a great storyline! It makes you think of what the afterlife could be like. It's also a sad movie as well! Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr. are a great team on screen! Both are great actors! This movie is also very spiritual to me. It makes me think of what it could be like when you die. Robin Williams was the best! An enjoyable film for the whole family... Sure... the chemistry between Robin and Greta is somewhat iffy. The film does have some very beautiful visuals and sumptuous set-pieces. The story is very beautiful if failed by a bit of miscasting... still, the film does tell an interesting storyline. Enjoy! :) What Dreams May Come. This movie showcases Robin Williams acting skills quite well. It is a story of a loving family that is struck twice by death,first the couple's two children. Four years later, the husband is killed in a massive car crash. The movie shows Chris (Robin Williams), the husband, going to Heaven. While exploring his heaven he finds that his wife has comitted suicide. The rest of the movie shows Chris discovering his children and a long time mentor as he explores Heaven and searchs Hell for Annie, his wife. This is Robin Williams acting in a Drama. It is not full of laughs, but it is not devoid of humor. If you are a Robin Williams fan or simply like romantic stories about going to or being in Heaven, this is a movie to see. It is similar in tone to Patch Adams or One Hour Photo. If you are looking for a Laughfest,try watching something else. May Robin Williams rest in peace. good enjoyed A friend recommended this to me as they knew I love Robin Williams. I had not seen this before and oh my word! Such a great movie. You get more out of it the more times you watch it. Great life lessons in this movie. I highly recommend it! Just saw this at a friend's home. I always like Robin Williams. I did not know the whole story but liked that its about the afterlife. I did not expect anyone to """"go to hell"""" for suicide after loosing their children and then later their spouse. It was a turnoff. I don't believe those in deep despair are to be jugdged totally by this desperate single action. Its as if their whole life counted for zero and a horrid few months or years of unbearable grief makes them horrible enough to burn forever. How mean and how silly for US to come to that belief. I think when outside horrors kill one's spirit and ability to go on, that many suicides are not thought out in any way. And they are very personal..not meant to harm anyone else. PTSD comes to mind.. loosing all one's family is another. (and the Bible was written by man btw) Suprised Robin would do this movie. This movie takes you on an unforgettable trip into the next life beyond the physical world. Well done with great actors and story line. great product This is not a religiously based movie even though it portrays life/death, reincarnation, heaven/hell, and it does make mention of God. Mostly, it's a story of LOVE. ROBIN WILLIAMS is absolutely BRILLIANT in this role. His performance is STELLAR. It is too bad he did not have more opportunity outside of comedy, because he is a VERY, VERY GOOD actor (versatile and intuitive). CUBA GOODING JR.(I think he is a great actor equally capable in drama/melodrama and comedy) is REALLY, REALLY GOOD in his role, as well (he has not appeared in movies nearly as often as he should have). ANNABELLA SCIORRA deftly holds her own with a performance that STUNNINGLY equals her costars performances. ENORMOUS PERFORMANCES by everyone in the movie. BREATHTAKING ACTING. The movie is slow. It did not bother me (especially considering the exceptional acting, the EXQUISITE visuals, and the AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS (especially the depiction of HELL--off the chart GOOD). BUT others may find the pace annoying. I read some of the other reviews and was saddened by some of the reviewers who let their religion get in the way of understanding THIS IS A MOVIE and THEREFORE A FANTASY. SO WHAT'S NEW THERE???? I do recommend this movie, but sparingly. It's not for everyone. I will share it selectively. The combination of the FANTASTIC special effects, BEAUTIFUL visuals, and, of course, the acting, the WONDERFUL performances, make this movie a real EXPERIENCE. LIFE, AFTERLIFE, DEATH, REBIRTH, GUILT, DAMNATION, REDEMPTION, and LOVE----ALL IN YOUR OWN MIND. Apparently when What Dreams May Come was initially presented in theaters my parents walked out. My brother was down on the movie, he heard it was bad... com'on, any move with Robin Williams is worth watching! Especially with Cuba Gooding, Jr... Surely it wasn't their best movie but if you give it time (until the very end) it is a worthwhile movie on an otherwise uneventful evening. This is a moving video where Williams is trying to deal with his wife's suicide after losing their 2 children and trying to save his wife's soul. Williams is impressive in this serious role. The visual effects are remarkable and will amaze you. This film deals with suicide, depression, heaven and hell in an almost dream/nightmare feeling. A touching, surreal movie. This movie keeps me in check for all the times I 'want out.' Sometimes being Catholic alone does not keep me in check, but this movie certainly reminds me of my religious beliefs of Heaven and Hell and I'd like to be able to see my best friend/cousin in Heaven - if I make it there. I know she did. In every sense of the word, this is the most romantic movie I can remember. That does not mean it is all sentimental hugs and kisses. It delves darkly into isolation and longing, death and despair; like an extended romantic poem, it presents some intensely subjective visions of a man's relationship to others and to the natural and supernatural worlds. In fact, as director Vincent Ward admits near the end of an excellent commentary track, this is nothing less than a New Age reworking of the ancient legend of Orpheus, who descended into the deepest depths of Hades' realm in hope of finding his beloved wife and restoring her to life and light. In this movie, however, the husband dies first and then begins his quest to be reunited with his love. Any review of this film--and any brief excerpt promoting it--must communicate a sense that it is visually dazzling, finding unprecedented techniques to create properly dreamlike visions of afterlife situations: The characters are immersed in settings vast and brilliant, inspired by a dozen painters from various eras of art history, brushstrokes and all. More surprising, perhaps, is the formidable acting of Annabella Sciorra and especially Robin Williams, communicating a whole palette of nuanced emotions in a noncomic role. (How could anyone complain of a lack of chemistry between them!) The movie's structure is unorthodox, with its strategically positioned, unexpectedly believable flashbacks, and throughout the journey, Michael Kamen's lush orchestral score sweeps us onward, adding hugely to the emotional experience. The surround sound is likewise spectacular. The weak link, if any, is the script. At best, it is properly unpredictable and sometimes exquisitely crafted (as in Chris's eulogy at the funeral of his teenage son). At other times it becomes unnecessarily vulgar or takes a few steps toward pretentiousness, which means that some viewers may be pardoned for finding individual moments off-putting or vaguely silly. All the same, we feel a bit cheated when an occasional line is hard to hear clearly on first viewing--for instance, because of Max von Sydow's accent. Though his relatively brief performance as a rather grumpy spiritual """"tracker"""" is too understated and matter-of-fact for my taste, old von Sydow does get one of the best moments, when he dramatically warns our hero that the real danger of Hell is not physical torment but losing one's sanity and, by implication, one's soul. And if this film succeeds in provoking some fresh thoughts and feelings about all our preconceptions regarding life after death, surely that in itself is a triumph. As a bonus feature, the DVD includes an early, alternative version of the movie's final two scenes (with their postproduction aspects not fully polished). I have a slight preference for this original ending, though I might have left its last two minutes on the cutting-room floor. While it presents a different, more explicit, more complex picture of what lies ahead for the two soul mates, it does not drastically change the feeling or message of the movie. We might also recognize that the theatrically released ending, though sometimes dismissed as overly """"cute,"""" does a neater job of bringing the story full circle. (There is one slight problem with the DVD, as both the trailers and the alternative ending have been vertically squeezed to an aspect ratio of nearly 3:1, making the actors appear fatter than they are. By contrast, the feature film is presented with an aspect ratio a bit narrower than the advertised 2.35:1, making us wonder whether the extreme left and right edges of the image have been chopped off.) At a time when virtually every Hollywood product steals ideas from countless films that came before, _What Dreams May Come_ is genuinely original and unique, not to say profoundly beautiful. It may appeal to the same audience as other modern """"love stronger than death"""" movies such as _Defending Your Life_ and _Just Like Heaven_, yet it is more serious and far more ambitious in its aims than those two. Connoisseurs of classic international cinema may observe some thematic connections with the works of Jean Cocteau, or may note that Vincent Ward and his team capture some of Powell and Pressburger's creative excitement about exploiting Technicolor in the service of a surreal spirit. More simply, _What Dreams May Come_ does what movies ought to do but rarely achieve: instead of merely telling a story, it helps us see the world in a new way, through *moving* visual images that no other medium could so effectively present. [Now can someone please explain why the closing credits include a credit for """"Russian folk music research""""?] Whenever Robin Williams stars in a film that is out of the ordinary of his comedic roles, he shows what acting is about. """"What Dreams May Come"""" is one of the examples of Williams's diverse filmography that surpasses the humor he is so well know for. The film focuses on how"""	What Dreams May Come

As a bonus, we also get an imaginary peek at life in London and a potential rivalry with Christopher Marlowe. The actors are flat out wonderful with our Juliet being the star even though she is not a trained Shakespearan actor. Since no one knows,anything about Shakespeare's private life, this phantasy is as good as any. I watched 10 minutes of it & privately complained to myself that I watched nine minutes too much. It was just plain horrible. It was the first time I had attempted to watch it. The fact that this monstrosity won the Academy Award as Best Picture over a masterpiece like """"Saving Private Ryan"""" showed that those who voted for it had all their taste in their mouths. I enjoyed this recently, even more than I did when it was first released. I love how the storyline becomes part of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It's a 4 instead of a 5 for me though because of the sexuality and nudity. I have a daughter/fan of Romeo and Juliet and I had hoped she could watch this but some of the content is inappropriate. I always enjoy watching this film. Paltrow and Fiennes are great together. Love the ending and its implications. Yep, I highly recommend this one. Acting is superb. Drama and more drama. Paltrow plays the role of Romeo on stage and falls in love with master Shakespeare as she writes the next day's scripts for each player. The Queen commanded the performance of Romeo and Juliet and the scenes unfurl to delight and surprise the audience. Darn good romance story. Excellent movie that everyone should see I absolutely loved this movie! Fiennes and Paltrow really had some great chemistry going on in this light hearted romantic comedy. There were other big/bigger names in the movie but these two sold me on love. nan Wonderful romance with humor and a great cast of actors. Absolutely one of my top five favorite movies. The play within the movie concept is so wonderful and brings Shakespeare's story to life in a whole different way. Loved just about everything about this movie! The acting was wonderful except, unexpectedly, from Ben Affleck, who played it in a contemporary style rather than sixteenth century style. The plot was darling and touching. In other words, thoroughly enjoyable. Sweet love story Excellent Movie! Highly Recommended! Great! Nicely done...a great portrayal of a true love story. Pretty good acting. This is one of the greatest movies of all time--witty, romantic, and Shakespeare. Great actors, superb sets, marvelous costumes, and wonderful music. Expected something better, but it was OK. I really do love this movie.....the history, the possibilites,and the charcters just make it great. I'll watch over and over good Just not a Shakespeare person Pretty much perfection, even if you were NOT an English Major. Strong and delightful cast gives us a humorous look at Shakespeare and friends trying to put together the as yet unwritten Romeo and Juliet. What they want is a comedy complete with a dog scene designed to please the Queen, want they get instead is a romantic tragedy with both leads dying and horror of horrors - A real woman acting on stage. Gwyneth Paltrow (in what has to be her best role) as Viola De Lesseps the young woman who dreams of being a actor took home a Oscar for Best Actress for this Oscar winning Best Picture. While only having 6 minutes in the film Judi Dench gave such a impressive performance she took home the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. The film won 7 figures with 6 more nominations. The director and Geoffrey Rush got nominations too. A great cast helped fill the bill Colin Firth, Ben Affleck, Tom Wilkinson, Martin Clunes, Rupert Everett and of course Joesph Fiennes as Will Shakespeare. A humorous adult comedy that is entertaining to watch. Well worth a look. I like this movie. I love this movie! Thank you so much! Great movie, very entertaining. My wife and I loved it! WATCHED THIS AND THE LATESTEST R&J TOGETHER DOUBLE TREAT Awesome, the copy was is great shape An excellent movie! One of those that you will watch again and again. The characters are funny the banter oh so witty One of my favorite movies of all time.... I'm a Shakespeare fan, so I liked the costumes, settings, and dialogue....even love the music. Well done sort of adaptation of Romeo and Juliet Nice film! One of those really good movies that I wanted to include in my collection, got it in a really good price. This movie is everything! I mean Joseph Fiennes!!! A wonderful film, full of wit, romance and adventure. Young Will Shakesoeare has a writer's block and is trying to find a muse to help him restore his gift. He is unhappily in love , until he meets Viola De Lesseps, a beautiful heiress, his true love, who is dreaming of being an actress. Women are not allowed on stage in Elizabethan England , so Viola disguises herself as Thomas Kent, a young actor and auditions for the part of Romeo. A passionate affair sparks between Viola and Will , during which time the play """"Romeo and Juliet"""" is being written. Judy Dench is phenomenal as Elizabeth I and so is Jeffrey Rush( Pirates of The Carribbean ) as Philip Henslow, the manager and theater agent of Will Shakespeare. Did I mention the charming( not so charming here)and talented Colin Firth( The King's Speech, Bridget Jones Diaries and ah, mr. Darcy in Pride And Prejudice)? Love, fights, laughter and tears ,all joined in this phenomenal script combined with phenomenal actors and true to historical fact plot. A true Oscar winner!!!! Well done! There's a reason that the bard is thus popular. This is a very entertaining movie and just plain worth the time to watch and enjoy the theater (or theatre if you are so inclined). Absolutely LOVE this classic story re-told. I love a good love story. The costumes are very detailed and colorful. This alone is worth the extra money in choosing Blue Ray. Because of the number of academy awards this film won [including best picture] I expected a remarkable film; which this is not. I guess the Academy just loves movies about the entertainment business; in this case, Shakespeare and putting on plays. [Another example is """"Birdman"""", which was truly much ado about nothing at all.] The script is clever but not brilliant. It was easy for me to imagine English grad students coming up with the sight gags, as well as the catch phrase """"it is a mystery"""" to explain how a play comes together. The references to other Shakespearean plays, as well as a few by Marlowe, were, well, about what you would expect. Like I said: clever, but not brilliant. Although Gwyneth Paltrow and Judi Dench are well worth watching, Joseph Fiennes [he plays Shakespeare] is boring; and Ben Affleck is jarringly out of his depth. As for the rest; workmanlike. So, three stars. And, considering this film'e Oscar competition was """"Saving Private Ryan"""" , shame on the Academy. Shakespeare in love will make you fall in love! Couldn't view this movie because AT&T service not working strong enough to connect. Kept stopping and starting. Fun movie and a great concept. The story of how """"Romeo and Juliet"""" was written. I had never watch this movie, but I did and I love love love it. Came in great condition. I'll be ordering more soon Watch it again and again , Have always loved this movie. Great love movie.. well done. no bomment This is my new favorite movie. If you love a good romance, and a story line and wonderfully acted roles to get lost in, then sit down and enjoy. A Great Love/Feel Good story Shakespeare In Love Starring Judi Dench is wonderful. A comedy set in 1593 with the accent on the behind the scenes of the playhouse, and the Royal Court. Fand of Judi Dench, and comedy lovers will like this the most. An excellent film; great actors, good script, well produced, really fun to watch. This is a film I watch over and over because it's so well done. god movie This is a wonderful depiction of what life might have been in Shakespeare's time and of the difficult conditions for writers, producers, and actors. The scenes of Romeo and Juliet are spellbinding. Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow have the chemistry to make the romance believable. All performances of the many, many stars and favorites are delightful. I have loved this movie for years, it was good to see it again! I highly doubt people were as attractive back then as some of the actors in the movie. Still, it was well acted. ...entertainment for a mature audience stay-cation. A little racier than expected, but it was nice to watch something from that era. Surprisingly, you don't have much interest in Shakespeare's play to enjoy this movie. The film industry inside jokes come fast and furious and you'll want to watch the film several times to catch them all. The script is really funny and very smartly written. The Oscars were well deserved. A great script, excellent acting, exceptional camera work and sound, historically impressive, wonderful love story - what more can you ask for? Many other reviewers have said it all. What more can I add? I loved this film. Get it, because you'll want watch it over and over again. Every viewing brings out another nugget of enjoyment. Superb acting... Great love story. I waited years to see it And was very pleased and surprised. Definitely worth the wait. I love this movie!! Love Gwyneth Paltrow, and Joseph Fiennes is gorgeous!!! Delightful movie!! Was it really like this for Shakespeare? Kind of gives you a feel for that time period. It was a refreshing, funny movie. Actors were great, especially Judi Dench. For people who like """"English Humor"""" type movies. Love this movie whether it is historically correct or not. The acting is solid and the actors as well. Very entertaining. delightful Movie we could watch several times and enjoy more each time. Perfect for V Day. Love to stay home and watch Amazon in warm house, comfortable chairs and refreshments If you love a good romantic movie. With some comedy. A bit of action. You'll enjoy this movie! A nice handful of stars. Gweneth Pal trow was delightful! A fun remake from the original! An enjoyable movie. A little comedy and a little drama. It was an interesting story and well acted. Worth the two hours to watch. A neat movie, a great story, lots of laughs, a total transport to a time far removed, and terrific acting by a handful of first rate people. This is a movie I put on when I need to get away for awhile. It immediately draws me into Shakespeare's world and keeps me there, laughing and empathizing, for the duration. Working the lines of Romeo and Juliet into the dialog is tremendous. The final performance of the play, as we know that the protagonist is about to be carried off to America much against her will, is absolutely wonderful. The brief appearance of Judy Dench as Queen Elizabeth puts the final"""	Shakespeare in Love
7974	"Joan Wilder  a mousy romance novelist  receives a treasure map in the mail from her recently murdered brother in law. Meanwhile  her sister Elaine is kidnapped in Colombia and the two criminals responsible demand that she travel to Colombia to exchange the map for her sister. Joan does  and quickly becomes lost in the jungle after being waylayed by Zolo  a vicious and corrupt Colombian cop who will stop at nothing to obtain the map. There  she meets an irreverent soldier of fortune named Jack Colton who agrees to bring her back to civilization. Together  they embark upon an adventure that could be straight out of Joan's novels.Action Adventure Comedy Romance , 1980s 80s action action-packed adventure beautiful-scenery chase chick-flick comedy entertaining exciting fast-paced fun fun-movie girlie-movie good good-action great great-movie indiana-jones jungle love-story original romance romantic romantic-comedy silly-fun swashbuckler treasure treasure-hunt ,""fun none It is action packed I just always love this movie. I have seen it multiple times and have never grown tired of it. Great fun to watch Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny Devito. I particularly like the seen with the bandito leader who reads the Joan Wilder books to his gang! Somewhat dated now, but I have enjoyed watching it from time to time. Love it! The DVD had slight scratch and paused two seconds or so otherwise fine condition Some of the best movies out there are the ones that don't stick to a single genre (action, romance, adventure, comedy, etc.) but blend elements from several. Movies like """"RED,"""" the """"Indiana Jones"""" series, and others give us multiple things to enjoy -- rollicking adventure, funny moments to lighten the tension, a sweet romance that doesn't hijack the story, etc. And while on the surface, """"Romancing the Stone"""" looks like an Indiana Jones ripoff, it's actually a fun contemporary adventure in the jungle, complete with a fish-out-of-water heroine, a lovable scoundrel, a sinister villain, a priceless treasure, and a lot to smile about. """"Romancing the Stone"""" stars Kathleen Turner as Joan Wilder, a romance writer who's shy and single despite her success. When Joan gets a call from her sister, who was kidnapped while searching for her husband's killer, she sets off to Columbia to pay her ransom with an ancient treasure map. After taking the wrong bus and nearly getting killed by the military police, she ends up in the company of American smuggler Jack (played by Michael Douglas), who's disgusted at being saddled with this naive woman but agrees to help her when she offers to pay him. As they set off through the Colombian jungle, pursued by the kidnappers (one of whom is hilariously played by Danny DeVito) and a sinister military officer who wants the treasure map for himself, the two find themselves falling in love, even as they set out to retrieve the treasure, a priceless stone simply called El Corazon, and save Joan's sister... This film is a lot of fun, filled with exciting action sequences and slapstick humor that's funny without being overly crude. The actors are clearly enjoying themselves, and watching Joan flounder through the unfamiliar world of South America will make you giggle and, at the same time, empathize with her character. Jack starts out as a selfish scoundrel, but both he and Joan see gradual character development as the film goes by, with Joan finding her own inner strength and Jack growing to care for someone other than himself. The villainous Colonel Zolo is a fairly one-dimensional villain, but the kidnappers, as secondary villains, are actually likable characters who are shown to not be complete scumbags. And the character of Juan, a drug lord who turns out to be an unexpected fan of Joan's work, is a hilarious one-scene wonder who makes the film memorable. There are some uncomfortable-to-watch scenes in this film, especially towards the very end. I was NOT expecting this film to suddenly get gory, and while it's only one scene, it's a squicky one. Be warned... Usually a film that tries to please everybody ends up ultimately pleasing nobody... but """"Romancing the Stone"""" is one of those rare films that can appeal to just about anybody. Whether you're here for the Indiana-style adventure, the humor, or the love story, you're bound to enjoy this film. Just skip the sequel... Adding to our library OK Excellent!!! Great Product! Great Price!! Arrived right on Time!!! Loved this movie, looking forward to purchasing Jewel of the Nile. Full of action and romance. I liked this movie better than any of the Indiana jone's movies. Michael Douglas looks great in this movie. Great actor. Great movie, Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas Jr. took a chic flick to the next level. FUNNY its is very Affordable price to buy this dvd.please buy from Amazon.its very great and funny movie.snk Thank you very much to Amazon. Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner shine in this movie and again in Jewel of the Nile. Fun to watch both of them. Always a great movie to watch. Classic Fun Fantasy Romance 80's Flick! That says it all. I remembered watching this as a kid and had to have it. Was thrilled to find it on here at such a reasonable price! Exactly what I expected. excellent product and service Just what I wanted and it arrived on-time! Terrible, terrible, terrible. It alternates between lame and vulgar. I quit about 2/3 of the way through. Everything I watched was terrible. There is nothing funny that happens. The characters are totally unlikable, the show is vulgar, and none of the """"action"""" or even """"adventure"""" that I saw was even remotely interesting. I haven't got the foggiest idea how this movie is so well liked. I guess people in the 80s were desperate for Indianna-Jones-like action. I challenge you to find anyone who watched this movie for the first time recently who actually thinks it's good. And how in the freak did this get a PG rating? There's a clearly-visible naked breast in the first scene. There's a part where a man dives into a woman's crotch and they just sit there enjoying it. I turned it off after a scene where the naked man is lying on the naked woman and very little is left to the imagination. I read about this stuff on the IMDB parents' guide, but what sounds relatively innocuous in writing is much more erotic and vulgar in actual execution. Both A list actors..Micheal and Kathleen were great in movies together! Great flash from the past. good movie Absolutely hilarious! Great movie love it As Described and fast service... Classic great Thx Buy it. I love it Excellent product and very fast delivery Old favorite - priceless Terrific adventure that has a lot of fun with the script. I had forgotten how good this is and how great Kathleen Turner is in it as is Michael Douglas. Danny DiVito has a great comic turn. Nothing like Mike Douglas in an 80's adventure flick! LOL! A classic that is always fun to watch. Adventure, romance, and comedy in one. Michael Douglas is quite the character, especially in the airplane scene. It's a great weeknight movie! Fun Movie! dd One of M. D.'s best movies as far as family viewing enjoyment. Has all the right script/scenery to keep the movie a popcorn treat right to the end. It was ahead of its time when it first came out and is still an enjoyable flick - especially cool ending. If you like alligators - you'll love this move... Micheal Douglas does it again! He is awesome What can you say about a true classic, except that it set the bar rather high for romantic comedies. A+++ Romancing the Stone, an oldie but goodie. We watched it years ago when it first previewed and thoroughly enjoyed it. Recently, when there was nothing else worth watching on TV, we watched it again on Amazon Instant, and we were rewarded with an entertaining, fun, and clean adventure. Love this movie. Good price and as described. Jamama Its a great movie. I recommend as advertised.... ok Good movie. its a silly movie but I like to watch it once a year for laughs enjoyed watching again Such a great movie,still love it after all these years. The storyline and acting, romance and action made this a favorite back then, and I enjoy it just as much now. Michael Douglas does an excellent job. The supporting cast is pretty good. The story has some fine moments. as a movie, it is terrible! he dVD itself worksOK. Michael at his best. He's one of the better actors in Hollywood and shows his stuff here. I've seen some reviews that compare this to Raiders Of the Lost Ark. I actually like this better. Kathleen Turner plays a romance novelist who's sister gets kidnapped in South America. She goes there and meets Michael Douglas who agrees to help her for a price. The movie has action adventure suspense romance and comedy. A little bit of everything. It has a supporting role by Alfonso Arau who made this and The Three Amigos pretty close together. I don't know how many people know this but he was one of them ain bad guys in The Wild Bunch. This was boring and silly. Clich too. This movie has eveerything Good movie. I bought this to replace our worn out VHS copy. I definitely recommend it. Funny movie. Great Hilarious movie! Great chemistry between the actors! Great This thing started off really, really slow, but when it picked up it was pretty entertaining. Not as good as the Indiana Jones movies or even the Allan Quartermain movies, but still a lot of fun once it gets going. My one gripe is that near the end of the flick he dives into the harbor at night to chase an alligator, or crocodile, or whatever ... and he catches it! Huh? Still and all good swashbuckling fun. Great movie My wife and I really enjoy this movie. We have watched it a number of times. Very funny. This movie is a classic adventure/romance with humorous situations that just about anyone would enjoy. My only disappointment is some of the mild vulgarity that could have been eliminated, but that kind of thing was prevalent at the time this movie came out. Great price on a classic movie This film never gets old and Michael Douglas is in rare form along with Kathleen Turner. Classic action and romance from three great actors. great old movie Adult Excellent movie I recommend it. This is a 1980's movie, I believe. The 1980's was a good decade for me. This movie was delightful when I saw it in the theater. That said, I think it is still delightful to me because it reminds me of that era. The characters have good chemistry. It is a simple romantic comedy that is not mushy. I hate mushy. Michael Douglas was a fox back then and Kathleen Turner was a sexy little number herself. Kathleen Turner's character is a lonely Romance Novelist who lives in New York and believes one day she will find a man just like her fictional characters do in her romance novels. One day, she gets a call from her sister who has been kidnapped in Colombia. She goes down to rescue her, meets Michael Douglas in a crazy and hilarious way--and they have some adventures together trying to save her sister. By the way, Michael's character is not helping out of the goodness of his heart--he is doing it for money--$375 in Traveler's Checks, to be exact. Kathleen's character has promised him that for his aid. The two are bickering a good deal of the time--but the ending is delightful, as I have already said. It is a fun little flick. Not academy award, earth shattering, but it does your heart good. great I love Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner together in this! it WAS A GOOD MOVIE. Great adventure. Family was visiting and starting discussing funny scenes from the movies. So after searching Amazon, we all sat down for a funny, nostalgic night at the movies! Classic 80s movie. Swashbuckling action and silly humor Fun movie with a fabulous cast. Classic movie. Enjoyable fun movie! Great Cast! Good old fashion viewing Good movie. My family enjoyed it. I just love this movie, and always have. I never tire of watching it. For me, it's worth the purchase. Danny DeVito is so funny in this movie. I'm glad I found a copy of the CD. If you enjoy comedy and adventure then this is the movie for you. I am so glad that I finally got this movie on dvd. I love this movie, Joan and Jack---mega chemistry funny Great movie.

7995	"U.S. Army Private Witt (AWOL) is found and imprisoned on a troop carrier by his company First Sergeant  Welsh.The men of C Company 1st Battalion 27th Infantry Regiment 25th Infantry Division have been brought to Guadalcanal as reinforcements in the campaign to secure Henderson Field and seize the island from the Japanese. They arrive near Hill 210  a key Japanese position. Their task is to capture the hill at all cost. What happens next is a story developing about redemption and the meaningless of war. Regardless the outcome.Action Drama War , amazing-cinematography anti-war best-war-films brutality cinematography life-&-death meditative melancholic narrated original oscar-(best-cinematography) reflective visually-stunning war war-movie wartime world-war-ii wwii ,""Cinematic masterpiece, the ultimate war film, a meditation on human nature, history, fear and philosophy. If Homer had ever picked a great war film it would be TRL. This gives us a fascinating, mysterious almost mystically-imbued vision of human nature and warfare. The cinematography is beyond description, completely realistic and fundamentally beautiful, at the same time crystal clear and filled with fear. The action scenes are remarkable, tangible, the acting of every single actor extraordinary. James Jones would be proud. A++++++ If you rewrote history and had all the marines sent to the Pacific as melancholy grad student poets and cynical narcissists, MAYBE you'd have this movie. It is beyond silly, it's truly insulting to the soldiers who gave everything for our freedom. Granted all soldiers go through their dark nights of the soul, and war sucks- but this movie is like a bad joke. Someone read the Cliffs notes of this battle and then made up everything else based on their own fantasy. Movie so inaccurate hard to watch. If you have ever seen documentaries of this island...it's nothing like this movie. The island was bombed before the Marines arrived...what's with this island paradise look? Didn't like this movie at all. Marines (or at least I think that's what this movie is portraying) acted like they've had no training, the officers weren't believable in their behavior. Don't remember seeing natives in the documentary films. I already loved the film, so waited so patiently for Criterion to come out, as it simply HAD to come out, with a definitive edition. I read and posted on the various fora, sent the emails, re-tweeted the enigmatic and happy Twitpic that Criterion posted, jumped all over the Criterion newsletter when they came out with their gnomic icon confirmation. I got the Blu-Ray the day it dropped, and have spent the subsequent couple days in a kind of reverie. I just watched the film -- which is, full stop for effect, absolutely STUNNING in Blu-Ray. Every technical aspect, from the color to the surround-sound (I so love the use of Charles Ives' """"The Unanswered Question"""" in the middle of a battlefield atrocity), is reference-quality AWESOME. I've yet to experience the commentary, but I've watched the insightful feature on James Jones and the novel from his daughter and listened to the chants; there's still the 15 deleted scenes and the wartime newsreels on Guadalcanal to go through, plus some other extras I'm sure. The essay is wonderful. If you think you experienced a religious ecstasy the first time you saw The Thin Red Line, just experience it again on this Criterion Blu-Ray and undergo true cinematic rapture. ** UPDATE ** I've watched all of the extra features, which are uniformly insightful and superb. Commentary: This is by cinematographer John Toll, production designer Jack Fisk, and producer Grant Hill. Criterion commentaries are usually of three breeds, I find: hit-or-miss commentaries by film scholars (Peter Cowie's Bergman commentaries would be hits, the dull """"you see the door in that shot? that door represents an opening"""" commentary on Solaris would be a miss), idiosyncratic commentaries by directors (Edward Yang, Jim Jarmusch), and then incredibly detailed production commentaries by people who worked on the production (The Last Metro, both Malicks). I like the director commentaries the most, since they usually combine both interpretation and production stories. The Thin Red Line commentary is completely about the production of the film, suffused with an almost worshipful regard for Terrence Malick. I found it a little dry. I would've liked discussion about, say, the poetry of the film -- the beautiful scene of Witt's mother dying, for example, which is like a Renaissance painting. Instead you hear that that scene was one of the last ones filmed. Actors: An almost 30 minute featurette, featuring interviews with Sean Penn, Kirk Acevedo, Thomas Jane, Elias Koteas, Dash Mihok and Jim Cavaziel. I didn't find this particularly interesting; the actors uniformly fawn over Malick's genius and basically congratulate themselves for participating in the film. Casting: A twenty minute featurette with the casting director, Diane Crittenden, featuring many audition tapes. Pretty interesting to see now well-known actors audition in the beginning of their careers (Nick Stahl, especially). Thomas Jane was quite the rockabilly. Music: Hans Zimmer talks about his ambitious (he calls it """"pretentious"""") ideas for the soundtrack of the film, particularly the idea that the music """"should keep asking questions."""" I didn't realize that Zimmer had done the thoughtful music for Thin Red Line: it's so different from the sonic bombasts he's been doing lately. Editing: Malick's team of editors, Billy Weber, Leslie Jones and Saar Klein discuss their work on their film. I found this feature to be the most interesting of the lot, particularly their discussion of how Malick pared the original 5-hour cut of the film (which, according to them, was plot-heavy, expository and filled with dialogue) into its current form, which is essentially a silent film layered with voiceover. Apparently Malick watched the assemblies with the soundtrack out, listening instead to Green Day. Who knew Terrence Malick liked Green Day? Deleted Scenes: These fourteen minutes of deleted scenes show what a different movie The Thin Red Line could have been: they're basically straightforward dialogue and action scenes, with little or no voiceover or music. One of the events that actually happened to James Jones that he put into the novel -- he was surprised by an enemy soldier while taking a crap, and managed to kill him -- turns out to have been filmed after all. Another scene shows George Clooney displaying some fine actorly chops. Kaylie Jones: James Jones' daughter talks about her father and the writing of The Thin Red Line in an illuminating featurette. Newsreels: Ten 2-minute newsreels from 1942 talk about the American involvement in the Solomon Islands and Guadalcanal in an incredibly gung-ho, Celebrate Our Boys fashion. It's an amazing counterpoint to the film. Melanesian chants: Audio-only feature on the native chants used in the film. Trailer: Watch this after you've seen the film, since like most trailers it completely gives everything away. 1)Malick is a great director. I've seen all of his movies. My favorite Malick film is New world followed by The Thin Red Line, Days of Heaven and last but not least Badlands. 2)The Criterion Thin Red Line was worth the wait. The Blue Ray version is awesome. 3)Do not expect a Private Ryan or Halls of Montezuma,this is a Malick flick,which means your gonna have to think a bit and get philosophical,because you are going to be bombarded by exquisite cinematic imagery,and characterizations that relay a unrealized, not so specific,gray area,point of view on war,men in war,and nature in war. Malick is not going to spell everything out for you,that's the whole deal with Malick,there's a strangness about his films that is captivating,and sublime. 4)I could have done without the cameos butthe acting is great. 5)I wish the Criterion edition would have added sme of the footage missing from Malick's original 6 hr version. My nephew saw the 6hr version,and said it was much better than the 170 minute chopped up theatrical version. I know many say the 170 minute version of TTRL is too long,but I,(as in all of Malicks films)see each frame visually poetic,and stylistic,they come together and the movie plays out with artistic abandon,purposely surreal,TTRL leaves you asking questions rather pushing you toward a specific sonclusion. 6)I have read some pretty negative reviews on TTRL,by amazon movie watchers,and when I first saw TTRL I was not that impressed with Malick's ww2 vision,but the more I watched it the better it got,today I really like this film. The Criterion version makes it even better. Malick is not presumptuous enough to question why there is war,or why men can kill other men rather he gives us an island somewhere in an emerald sea,with a native people,life bearing nature,2 armies of armed and commanded soldiers,all making war and death on each other,and all we can do is watch. 7)I wish Criterion would do ONE EYED JACKS--there is not a decent version (DVD)of Brando's great western anywhere to be had... The Criterion Collection has released a superb 2-disc edition of Terrence Malick's 1998 film adaptation of James Jones' novel of World War II. I first saw the film in a theater when it was first released, then later again on an earlier DVD release. I know that a lot of people think that this is the greatest war movie ever made but, unfortunately, I'm not one of them. Yes, visually it is absolutely stunning and it has some powerful scenes and terrific performances (e.g. Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, John Savage). However, if any movie could afford to lose 30-45 minutes of its running time, this is it. As in all of Malick's movies, the nature shots are fantastic, yet its dramatic structure is almost non-existent. A story about an Army company and its many members might work very well in a novel, but a screenplay has a definite structure that a writer must adhere to if it is going to work. I know the movie is about the battle for Guadalcanal, just like GONE WITH THE WIND was about the Civil War. But, what's the movie version of THE THIN RED LINE really about? Who is its protagonist? So many characters appear, and then disappear (sometimes without explanation), throughout the film, which makes that a difficult question to answer. """"War is Hell and it destroys the tranquility of nature."""" I assume that that is one of the messages that Malick is trying to convey. But then, as illustrated by one of the film's opening shots, nature can be pretty brutal, too. I have nothing against a film having a philosophical bent, but not if it's going to sacrifice good storytelling. On the other hand, Criterion's new transfer for this film is magnificent, and they've also included their usual array of first-rate extras, including audio commentary by cinematographer John Toll and others, interviews with many of the cast members and production staff, deleted scenes, audition tapes, a very informative and touching interview with James Jones' daughter, WW II newsreels of Guadalcanal and much more. Additionally, there is a 38-page booklet, filled with essays about the picture. If you like this movie, then this is certainly the edition to own. Michael B. Druxman One young man reflects on his life as a child, who witnessed his Mother's strength and bravery when she faced death; he wonders how will he face death? Another seasoned man tells us in a direct way that he has sucked up to his superiors all these years in hopes to get promoted in the army; this has become an obsession that might lead to his madness. Then a native man strolls past armed soldiers giving the true impression of a soul untouched by the fear, the anger and threat of war. We are shown beauty amidst horror and sheer terror that these men feel in a mad world. Mallick's camera cruises past barracks and young, strong bodies who express their thoughts of fear, frustration and regret. In one moment there's quiet contemplation and then sudden images of violence and explosive chaos. The camera's intensity matches the soldiers' heartbeats in this wonderful film. The Thin Red Line is a meditation on the human condition during battle; men who have been to war, generation after generation facing the inevitable and the non-enviable. Who decided the solution to conflict is this inhumane mess? Mallick asks these questions to which have never been answered to this day. This film is a masterpiece of poetic cinema. OK, I understand that this is a film that many people like (it has been out on DVD for a while, and there are plenty of reviews of its quality around--on DVD).

It is ok It's so hard to see how much 18 years of improvements in film making can make this film be a jarringly inept mess. A kids' movie even back then, I can't see any modern kid older than eight """"buying into this production."""" No need to list the errors. I had to fast forward many times and didn't even really watch the ending, because it was so sappy. Today's typical Disney work is as fraught, no doubt, with today's """"acceptable qualities,"""" that a decade's growth will similarly reduce to a """"klunky effort from the past."""" Also kinda miffed that the film was such a leering slavering peeping-at-Charlize-Theron-in-fully-blossomed-allure vehicle. It was way too much in the ogling department. Paxton was not up to selling the material; phoned it in. Gave it three stars because it has some viewing value to young kids whose parents watch with them to explain the violence. The black and white version of Mighty Joe Young wowed me back-when; might have to watch it again to see if I'm remembering correctly my inner-ten-year-old's experiences. In 1998, this was a 4.5 star film. But all the audiences globally have evolved -- this is history, on the hoof, clomping inside each nervous system -- ain't no looking homeward angels to be found. Maybe in another 20 years, this work might become """"cute"""" because of its """"adorable"""" film errors. If I'm around, it might just be funzies to review this dynamic. I'll be 92 years old though. Don't count my having this as a concern. Heh. This movie is okay. I liked the first one that was filmed. All in all it is good viewing. Loved watching it, inspirational, how when light is given it remains to the end. Mt 5:16 cyndy Disney. Enough Said. awesome great movie I love this movie and my nephew is 2 years old now love it as well. Modern day remake of the 1949 classic. FUN! My kids love these!!! Great Price!! Fast Shipping!!! PERFECT CONDITION!!! Made Christmas Shopping STRESS FREE!!! Thank you!!! I will shop again!!! ok thanks I love the original Terry Moore version, and I love this one. The sense of freedom and life is strong in this new version. The villains are perhaps a little narrowly drawn in the newer version but I find Joe and Jill to be very real. Charlize did a very fine job in this early career effort. I think the reality of Joe is well realized; great technical work. And the music is wonderful. Love this movie A wonderful human nature movie. My favorite Excellent family movie Did not purchase as advertised great movie Great DVD! Great service! Surprised this picture didn't do better at the box office. After making the dreadful Hearts and Souls (with Alfre Woodard, trying to out-do GHOST) and Speechless (the romantic comedy which killed the careers of both its stars, Geena Davis and Michael Keaton) director Ron Underwood bounced back with this inventive, lively remake of an earlier 1949 movie. It should have made Charlize Theron, who plays Jill Young, a big, big star, but instead, Charlize had to bumble on for a few more years before winning an Oscar. James Horner's music outdoes his heart-wrenching symphonic themes for TITANIC, BRAVEHEART, and THE ROCKETEER, with a touch of African percussion and wood and wind instruments that bring the plains of Africa into mind whenever you hear them. Charlize has a lovely song, """"Wind Song,"""" sort of a lullaby for Mighty Joe, that should have been a hit on the scale of """"MY HEART WILL GO ON."""" But somehow people just weren't interested in this picture. Maybe the forthcoming remake of KING KONG by Peter Jackson will have better luck with audiences. It will have more publicity, for sure, for I don't think the studio was really behind Ron Underwood to the same degree that New Line supports Jackson. What a cast! Beyond Charlize and Bill Paxton, the movie also features Naveem Andrews (who plays Sayid on ABC's LOST) in a rather comic role, and also everyone's favorite REGINA KING from RAY. If you liked AU HASARD BALTHAZAR by Robert Bresson, you will also enjoy MIGHTY JOE YOUNG the remake. Sure, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is a somewhat mushy movie. SURE, it has all the cliches you expect. Sure, some of the special effects are a little rough. But sure, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is a wonderful entertaining movie, sure to bring a little tear to the eye, and entertain even the hardest cynic. In updating the 1949 classic, director Ron Underwood (who gave us the first TREMORS)has pleasantly remade the original to make it more accessible to these ever changing times. From the opening scenes where little Mika Boorem (Hearts of Atlantis) and her doctor mommy Linda Purl are besieged by heartless poachers to the last thirty minutes where some really exciting climactic action scenes occur, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG delivers the poignant tale of an oversized gorilla who just wants to be loved. The special effects crew do a fine job on giving Joe his own personality with the especially effective use of Joe's eyes, and ironically, he and Charlize Theron have a remarkable screen chemistry, actually better than her chemistry with co-star Bill Paxton. But then the movie isn't really about Paxton and Theron; it's about Joe and Charlize. The dynamic Regina King (from RAY) does a nice turn as the doctor who also bonds with Joe; and even self-centered David Paymer as the conservancy head finally warms up to Joe. Of course, a movie like this would be nothing without villains, and we have two good ones here: Croatian actor Rade Sherbedgia wants revenge on Joe because after shooting Theron's mother, he loses a finger and thumb to the then infant Joe; Peter Firth (Equus) is the more compassionate (?) sidekick who claims that Rade is """"not a hunter, but a murderer."""" The climax in the heart of LA, on the freeways and finally at Palisades park delivers nicely. I wasn't expecting a whole lot when we bought this movie, but it was a pleasant surprise and I recommend it for family viewing. A feel good story for the whole family, don't expect """"Mighty Joe Young"""" to knock you off your feet. Instead, watch it for the good """"Beauty and the Beast"""" storyline that is well outlined for any age group to watch. There is some violence in this movie, and smaller children may be frightened by """"Joe"""" at first, but if they can control themselves through the first few minutes, they'll fall in love with him. There is very little, if any, foul language. The story is simple: Girl and giant ape are moved to the city, girl and giant ape want out, man in love with girl helps, everyone ends up happy. If you're interested, """"Joe"""" looks fairly realistic, especially for the time this flick was made. Overall, a good family show that all can watch. I highly recommend it for its entertainment value. Ok, this movie makes me cry every time i see it. stupid i know, but what the hey. I love both Bill Paxton and Charlieze Theron, so that was why I saw it initially, but I just love it. Joe looks realistic with the exception of his tongue, which looks goofy, but it still works for me. great kids movie i think too. Here is a live action movie that Disney shouldn't have made. And the Walt Disney company doesn't come out with a lot of live action movies. Or just to the animated movies, but they made this, along with Heavyweights, The Santa Clause, The Jungle Book, 101 Dalmatians. Max Keeble's Big Movie is a lot better than this mess. The friendship between Joe and Jill was so sweet and touching. They cared so much about each other. Honestly, this isn't a common friendship you'd find. The movie has a great contrast in it. Sometimes it's hilarious, sometimes sad, sometimes exciting. When it came to the part where Joe fell with the ferris wheel, I cried, fearing that Joe had died, but to my surprise, it was still alive! This is a tale that will be always in my mind. Another great Disney production! This update of the 1949 movie Mighty Joe Young is nowhere near as good as it could have been, but it is good enough for a family evening of DVD viewing. I don't think kids under ten years old will notice it's deficiencies, most of which are caused by a far-fetched, predictable plot. In a situation obviously taken from Gorillas in the Mist, a woman scientist studying mountain gorillas in Africa is killed by poachers. This being a Disney production, she has her young daughter with her. The mother is gunned down while fleeing with a baby gorilla they have named Joe. Her dying request is that the child forever protect Joe. [Remember, I said kids would really like this movie. In fact, my brother and sister-in-law loved it. Of course, they also raved about George of the Jungle.] The daughter, Jill Young, grows up to be a strikingly beautiful young woman. She should be, since she is played by Charlize Theron, who is reminiscent of a young Rita Hayworth. Joe, a genetic anomaly, also grows up. He winds up being a 2,000 pound gorilla. Jill apparently never left the African village, and her education must have come from the scriptwriters. Jill and Joe are still best friends and run around playing hide and seek. Enter Greg [Bill Paxton], a doctor of something or other, who has come looking for a rumored giant gorilla. He finds Joe, who would have stomped on him, if Jill hadn't come along. Greg convinces Jill that Joe would be safer in a wildlife refuge outside of Los Angeles. She finally agrees, and somehow they transport the huge animal without anyone finding out. The writers certainly had no idea how this was done. In one scene, Joe is in Africa. In the next, he is in a big rig on an LA freeway. The refuge is full of stock characters. There is the kindly but incompetent Director. We have the Chairman of the Board, who is interested in Joe only as a way of getting donations. The villains, of course, are the very same poachers who devastated Jill and Joe's lives. Joe recognizes them before Jill does. This is one smart gorilla, and he soon escapes, reeking some wonderful havoc on, appropriately enough, Hollywood Both Paxton and Theron are excellent actors, and they do their very best with the material they were given. Their careers remain in great shape. Both the regular and the computer special effects are excellent in Mighty Joe Young. While I was watching it, I didn't think the African scenes looked very authentic. As it turns out, the movie was filmed in Hawaii. Again, kids will thoroughly enjoy this adventure. Parents should find it tolerable, except for those who are like my brother. He thought it should have been nominated for Best Picture. His thirteen year old just rolled her eyes. I saw this movie today and Judson Mills is in it. You can't tell since he's almost an extra. He's the guy in the yellow car that Joe steps on and yells at the cop, """"Come on, I'm already twenty"""	Mighty Joe Young
8010	"British sisters Hilary du Pr   and Jacqueline du Pr   are both talented musicians  Hilary a flautist  Jackie a cellist. With regard to their musical prowess  they have always had a friendly competitive nature with each other  fueled in large part by the want of their pianist mother  Iris  for them to achieve musical greatness. But underlying this friendliness is a deep desire to be truly better than the other. Despite or perhaps in part because of her flamboyant performance style  the younger Jackie emerges from the shadows of older Hilary's more triumphant childhood successes to become the renowned musician in the family. Although both continue with their music and both end up marrying (Hilary to Kiffer Finzi  and Jackie to pianist Daniel Barenboim)  Hilary focuses on her home life  whereas Jackie focuses on her career. A seemingly odd request by Jackie to Hilary is later understood  but Hilary's agreement to that request demonstrates the true nature of their loving but unusual sisterly relationship.Drama , based-on-a-book based-on-book biographical biography biopic classical-music complex drama dramatic eccentricity emotional exceptional-acting family-drama good-music great-acting mental-illness mozart music musicians original oscar-(best-actress) relationships sisters story touching ,""Emily Watson performs a miracle here with her portrayal of the famous cellist Jacqueline du Pre. I rarely find any actor successful in playing the role of a musician. Inevitably the hand and arm movements are unconvincing and when acting the part of a pianist the actor is not seen with their hands on the keys for that reason. In this movie Emily appears to play the cello with all the intensity of the famous artist she portrays making me a true believer that we were indeed watching the real artist at work. I call that a miracle performance! We see the early years when Jackie and her sister Hilary grow up together in a household that supports their musical talent and then in a strange twist of fate the more apparently talented of the two sisters gradually ends up in second place next to her sister who eventually becomes a world renown cellist. This happenstance leads to some strange psychological quirks going on between them. Jackie is later stricken with a debilitating disease that robs her of the ability to play anymore; a cruel and horrid thing to happen leading Jackie to question her worth as a human being. Under this stress she runs """"home"""" to her sister and husband leading to a strange triangle that entangles all of them. The action plays out against a backdrop of ravishing music that reminds us every second of the talent being robbed here. The plot is provided from the contents of a book sister Hilary wrote about the family leading many musicians to complain that surely this is more fiction than reality. Frankly I don't care; the film is so magnificent I can take the plot as is and mourn the loss of a great cellist and wonderful human being. Both actresses won an academy award nomination for their performances. The movie is ultimately very sad, everyone involved should feel proud for what should be recognized as a tribute to a great artist. Four stars only because we don't get Jackie's version of the story. The whole movie is based on Hillary's version of what happened. Otherwise, it would get five stars. Not at all closed captioned as advertised. Also poor quality. Funny and memorable. Excellent This is a biography we're told, of the two Du Pre sisters encouraged to become musicians by their doting parents and especially the piano playing mother. Jackie takes up the cello and Hilary the flute. They play together early on and develop a strong symbiotic relationship to the point of becoming almost telepathic with each other. But eventually separations happen....first the mother is cut out of the pack in favor of a 'professional' pianist, and then Jackie is offered a solo tour so she goes off leaving her flute-playing sister behind. Hilary continues her studies with occasional playing here and there and is approached by a conductor/music director who says he wants her to play but it turns out he actually wants to marry her, and if we can believe the coincidence of it all he follows her home, pushes himself on her and her parents and is in the process of rushing her off on a first date at the very moment Jackie, bored and upset by her treatment as a touring musician with no love in her life, shows up on the doorstep to visit with her sister. Hilary goes off with Kiren anyway and the drama begins. I suppose one could say this is a movie about the love/hate relationship that develops between people who have outside, or other, needs. But of course it is also about a couple of well-known artists...Jackie eventually marries Daniel Barenboim...so my guess is some of the rougher edges have been smoothed over. For example we are given a glimpse of Jackie's lust for Hilary's husband but it is presented in such a way we're left to wonder at who wanted to do what with whom, and why. And hopefully that explains the disconnected way I feel about the movie. But wait. I bought it purely because it is an award-winning movie starring Emily Watson so to view it from that perspective alone it is a winner. Emily is fantastic in her role of a woman who runs the gamut of emotional states from bliss to damnation, the former being those times when she and her sister are in synch, the latter being the illness which overtook her in her late 30s/early 40s causing her to lose control of her hands and, progressively, her entire body until she dies an untimely death. I guess the next time I feel in the need for a good cry I could do worse than watch this movie again. I have seen this film several times, and I have mixed feelings about it. The film catches the disappointment and disgruntlement of Hilary du Pre/Rachel Griffiths, because she was supposed to be the star and talented, and her sister, who needed help, became great. Hilary taught her sister the scales, and it was Jackie, who found good teachers, and eventually superseded her. Jacqueline """"Jackie"""" du Pre/Emily Watson is a star. Her stardom is rather sudden, and you catch that she is never quite satisfied, perplexed about her ability, not even passionate about her talent, and alarmed by her stardom. Seemingly jealous of her sister's marriage, Jackie marries a """"rock star"""" of classical music. My favorite parts are when after she plays for a vast audience, she stands up to be congratulated by their thunderous applause. Hilary tries to be on par. She is dissuaded from going forward because of a rude teacher, and she marries very young. She appears contented with marriage, and she cares immensely for her sister. Jackie is lost. And she has an affair with Hilary's husband with Hilary's persuasion and approval. Then Jackie is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which undermines her career, and puts her in the control of her sister. I enjoyed the film, but not enough was given to Jackie's genius. She is herald as a prodigy, an al-time great, and this film shows little appreciation for her talent. This film is told through Hilary's point of view, and of course, Hilary's own elementary talent and magnanimous is on full display; though even Hilary's own daughter disputes her mother's account, claiming that her father was a serial adulterer, who seduced her vulnerable aunt, and it had nothing to do with Hilary's generosity. Others have been disgusted with Hilary's portrayal of her self-importance, and her sacrifice of her sister to achieve some meaning in her life. I liked this film, and the actresses give wonderful performances, though it may have no semblance to reality. The film as a film as good, and both Rachel Griffiths and Emily Watson give tremendous performances. But I keep in mind this film is not based on fact. And despite Hilary's intent to come out ahead, Jackie (even in death) still manages to outshine and trump her sister. (And to be honest - I have siblings, whom I adore. And if they were better than me at anything, even things that I loved, I would focus on their talent, and not anything bad that happened to them later. In fact, any illness or falling would be a side note, written after the film ended, right next to the credits.) Coming from a family of musicians, I know that sometimes creative people can think that they are above conventional morals, that general rules (like marital fidelity) don't apply to them. Isn't it sad how the stable, the level-headed kid in the family is expected to be compassionate and understanding? This is the cross that Hilary takes upon herself when her sister Jackie develops psychological problems. When Jackie starts sleeping with Hilary's husband, Hilary makes no attempt to confront either one of them. Because Hilary is no longer performing, being a wife and a mother, she thinks of herself as inferior to her famous sister. She just swallows the hurt and crawls into her children's bed. That act was very symbolic. She was denouncing her womanhood and devoting herself 100% to motherhood. one of the greatest Outstanding performances by both Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths!!!! I saw the movie 3 times. True story, extremely sad and difficult ending. Two thumbs up, way up!! Emily Watson , one of the greatest British actresses of out time!! excellent As advertised A FABULOUS FILM ABOUT 2 SISTERS WHO ARE REMARKABLY CLOSE.BOTH ARE MUSICIANS FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD. THIS FILM TELLS THE STORY OF THEM TOGETHER AS CHILDREN AND THEN THE STORY OF EACH ONE WHEN GROWN UP. WONDERFUL FILM!! EMILY WATSON IS OFF THE CHARTS!! This is somewhat like attending group therapy in an asylum. Hilary is such a mouse, so co-dependent that she can refuse star sister Jackie nothing, including her own husband. Jackie as played by the brilliant Emily Watson is all frustration, anger, and nervous energy. She is wonderful to watch in all of her character progressions, even though she makes Jackie as a character quite unlikeable. This is a case history in dysfunctional relationships - why was it made? Gone are the days when film biographies were about people who were extraordinary human beings. See this for Watson only - who was deservedly Oscar nommed for the role- she should have won! I know a good human story when I hear it. In real life, people are flawed and not perfect and never will be. Human desires are real as is jealousy and rivalry. This film is one of the so very few today to display that aspect. A very good movie based on a true story with a tragic ending. Video quality could be better. Had to watch this for class. Waste of my time, honestly. Emily Watson a pleasure to watch as always, excellent performance. Film writers turned Hilary into a doormat, blech. Watch it at your own risk. A movie about a genius cellist named Jackie du Pre , might been better done by Emily Watson, who I loved in Punch Drunk Love, but might have been better if all the characters had been dead in real life before it was done, based on the book """" A Genius in the Family"""", but a decent movie. A wonderful film score to an intriguing, intense film. the cello paying is mangicinet and also some of the original compositions. Hillary was slightly envious of not having fame and fortune and Jackie was very much jealous of not having the warmth and comfort of a family. I have to admit it took me by surprise that Jackie suffers much more than just the isolation and repetition of being booked for concerts years in advance. The audience sees her exhibit strange behavior, then very slowly sad flashbacks reveal why. The film stock and cinematography make this look authentically 1960's without drawing attention to itself. I have read the reader reviews and comments and agree with those who were much moved by this film. Just want to add or reiterate that if you see this movie fresh, without any knowledge of this story beforehand and judge it by the work of the director and actor alone, as I did, I believe the movie will hold you in its grip continuously as the film unfolds. It is a superbly crafted film. This is an outstanding film with bravura performances by all the actors and actresses who grace it. Emily Watson is dazzling as world reknowned cellist, Jacqueline Du Pre, and Rachel Griffiths gives a heartwarming portrayal of Hilary, the more grounded Du Pre sister. British director Anand Tucker does a masterful job of capturing and exploring the often complex and symbiotic relationship between these two sisters, one of whom reaches heights in the music world of which most may only dream. Most of the film is bifurcated in that it is told from the perspective of each of the sisters, with the same scenarios being viewed through"""	Hilary and Jackie

This is a great movie and quality was great. good condition This is one of my favorites-like with some other movies; I found I watched it every time it was on cable so I decided to just buy it-it touches your heart and makes you laugh too- a good family movie I think. Purchased this for my wife, who has been looking for this movie for some time now. I recall watching this movie once a long time ago and was not a huge fan of the content (seems to be predominately a chick-flick). However, I can see the merit in viewing this movie at least once, regardless of gender or movie taste. This movie does a great job at presenting topics that are not often portrayed in Hollywood, but have real-life implications for many people. Overall, I feel that this was a great buy. My wife really likes it. One of the best movies ever made! I laughed, I cried and sometimes at the same time! I would recommend this to all viewers. I am not really a fan of all RomComs but this one transcends a genre. was a wonderful portrayal and Juliette nailed the character so well. was moving and heart touching. great movie to see Great price for a classic. Fast shipment. I can watch this over and over again, with fantastic acting and friendly content! Never even knew this movie existed. but came across it and wow it was worth getting. it was exciting from the beginning to the end. made you cheer for the underdog. Just ran across this movie, THE OTHER SISTER, while surfing thru cable channels. Planned to just watch a little, but I stayed all the way to its feel-good teary ending. (Yeah, I shed a few too.) I know the premise of two mentally challenged people getting married is probably not very realistic or sensible, but just remember Coleridge's """"willing suspension of disbelief"""" and you're sure to get caught up in this 'special' love story about a special couple whose special song is """"Seventy-six Trombones."""" Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribsi are both excellent. A love story with a kind of innocence seldom found in pictures today. I recommend it. Good Quality! I've never been a big Juliet Lewis fan but I fell in love with her in this movie. She and Giovanni Ribisi were flawless in their roles. I cried because my heart broke for them and I cried when they triumphed. One of the best most underrated movies ever. The other sister was a nice story until they had to throw in queers. Why must Hollywood push that sin on us? The Mother is against her queer daughters """"partner"""" as she should be yet donates to queer stuff she sends very conflicting messages to her daughters. This could have been an excellent movie if moral standards had been applied. No wonder my favorite movies are all from the 1940's Movie showed up in Great condition!! Disc plays perfectly and the movie is one of my favorites!! A Wonderful Classic! I cry every time I watch this movie. The acting from Both actors who are portraying mentally disabled people blows my mind every single time. It's just a cry fest, so so so much crying. Diane Keaton knows how to put one over but all the other actors have to share in the glory of this movie. It is one of only two movies where I laughed out loud and wept many tears AT THE SAME TIME. A really marvelous movie. An obscure movie that reminds me much too much of my growing up with my mother, perfectly played by Diane Keaton. but it is life reaffirming and joyful in the end. What, an enjoyable flick, from beginning to end, have watched it several times, and enjoy it each time I see it !! Its such a wonderful movie and even though this young lady has a disability she is able to learn to live independently and find true love :) ONE OF THE VERY BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEE A MUST SEE BY ALL IT SHOW THE TRIALS THOSE WITH SPECAIL NEEDS HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY THis film has a great cast and Julliette Lewis does a fantastic job of becoming her character.

This movie has been one of my all time favorites and have been watching it over and over for many years. The two lead characters played by Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi , play their characters like a second skin which shows how talented they both are as actors. I've liked all the movies that these two actors have been in that I have seen. They are a joy to watch in """"The Other Sister""""! I've loved this movie for a long time. Had a girls night, and rented it,and we were surprised that although funny in some places, the over all movie left us feeling very poignant and introspective. If you haven't seen this, watch it!

THE DVD ARRIVED IN GREAT CONDITION AND THE SERVICE WAS QUICK, TOO. I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE DVD'D FROM YOU. THANKS YOU VERY MUCH, greatnine@msn.com I remember seeing this move come to the big screen and noticed that Juliet Lewis was in it. I love her performance a great deal. Well tonight I finally got a chance to see this heart warming movie on DVD. I am a huge fan of Keaton as well. His performance here is unique and vast. She will always amaze me in her acting if it is from movies like Crimes of the Heart to The First Wives Club, Father of the Bride, even Baby boom. She will forever be an amazing talent woman, of acting in my book. I saw Lewis for the first time in The Evening Star yet another fine film that is a sequel Terms of Endearment. This move is well directed and well paced as well. I was about give up on it about 45 min into the move talking about the story line. But I was"""	Other Sister The

It's not. Ultimately it is not about those people out there, reptilians or not, it's about you and your mind, it's about taking control of your mind and about taking control of your life. The DVDs are also about becoming aware of your connection with Infinite Loving Wisdom within you, and about not taking any stories that are served for granted, but rather asking questions about """"truths"""" that are served and that people just take for granted. The DVDs are about giving yourself permission to think for yourself, to express your uniqueness, to express your creative potential, to listen to that little voice within that whispers """"I CAN"""". The last CD has about 2 hours of information on hypnosis, how the brain processes information and how we get subliminally influenced. As a hypnotist myself, I can attent to the fact that your awareness of manipulative methods used - not only in forms mentioned on these DVDs, but also in a form what we call """"hypnotic language"""" patterns or covert hypnosis - reduces the ability of another to use these methods on you, because you consciously catch them. David Icke's Matrix is the first concept on reality I've seen that makes any sense is this crazy world. Those human beings who choose not to accept this concept of reality are living an ILLUSION and they have been completely taken over by the """"ILLUMINATI AGENDA."""" Mr. Icke presents the material in a down to earth fashion that anyone can grasp, that is if he or she has a mind that's not consumed by previous programming from childhood. In essence! We are what we THINK! FEEL! and SEE! I truly wish humanity would break out of their self contained negative mold and see for themselves that REALITY IS WHAT WE MAKE IT! If you have any conscious you'll reccommend the Matrix to your friends, family and loved one's before it's too late. THE MATRIX IS A MUST SEE TO BELIEVE! That's what I'm doing. Rick Thorne not really sure how this thing rates 5 stars overall, especially considering how 75% are 5 stars and the rest are less. math tells me this cannot be possible. this was pretty hard to watch. if you start to watch and agree right away, then it may be easier. but if you come in and try to see where he's coming from, it's difficult to get past the ancient memes presented. amazon listed this as a 2017 release, but all the jokes were passed around the internet in 2005. ok, we get it...you hate bush. after hearing the same joke a million times, it just gets old. it probably isn't from 2017, which should also be obvious from the video quality. but even from the dated standpoint, it's like when your friend sends you the forwarded email that you read 10 years ago. not only is it just the same joke over and over, but it just shows up randomly. it doesn't go away. you snickered the first time, almost smiled the second time, and now someone thinks it's the best thing EVAR if david icke wants me to """"open my mind,"""" then he should probably do more than produce his """"research"""" that took so many years, but yet everyone has been talking about it for years like it was so obvious. research usually produces something new. and of course if you don't think like he does, then you're the one that has the """"baa-baa mentality."""" do i detect irony? if he got into some other, more interesting stuff, then it's a shame that it was such a turnoff in the first 24 minutes great I'm not going to get in a long winded articule here but I will relate a bit of info about this set. Basically all the things you have been told about the pyramid on the back of the dollar the statue of liberty the statue on top of the white house and alot of other unusual and seemingly strange symbols proliferating our modern society are not innocent greek mythology symbolism of freedom as were have been told. But are actually the work of a secret society that harks back to the days of old that behind the scene have been forever controlling our destiny and controlling our minds. These society's are active today and are running our governments and our world banking institutions. Steeped in symbolism and occult rituals these organizations have upsurped our power over our own destinys and are basically writing their own chapters in our lives. I won't go on here but if your dissatisfied with the way you view life and war and politics in general then you really should consider the investment of one of these videos and discern the truth for yourself...but be warned once outside the box of the matrix your life will never be the same...you have been warned..:) Join David Icke (pronounced: I- KEY) on this 3 disc 360 minute journey through the illusory matrix commonly referred to as physical reality. If you're unfamiliar with the bizarre, highly unorthodox world of Mr. Icke where nothing is what is appears to be it's time to sit down, get comfortable and open your chakras as you prepare to """"follow the information"""" trail with David and see where it eventually leads. Disc 1 & 2 investigates our socio-economic-political climate as we rapidly move towards a unified, one world government: - Learn how reverse symbolism, subliminal programming and encoded mantras like """"weapons of mass destruction"""" are used to polarize our subconscious into hostile factions making it easier for the `Powers That Be' to manipulate the populace headlong into war like lambs to the slaughter. - Discover the existence and machinations of an age old secret society, the Illuminati, working behind the scenes of every national government and major corporations to control the hearts and minds of unsuspecting civilians. Learn to discern the signs, symbols and rituals by which this organization can be recognized. Disc 3, Ah..., this is where the scenarios presented will really begin to challenge your most treasured paradigms. Cast all your pre-conceptions aside if you dare and imagine a world of alternate possibilities. What if these corrupt world leaders identified in the first two parts of the presentation are only the front men or puppets for a powerful race of non-human beings. Are inter-dimensional shape-shifting, reptilians moving in and out of our holographic reality and leading us to a totalitarian future beyond our wildest nightmares? If so is there something we can do to stop them? According to Icke there is. As David Ickes' deprogramming session comes to an end wait patiently until the wave patterns swirling around you reassert themselves into recognizable forms and your molecular structure reassembles before attempting to move about. Take a deep breath and relax. Do you feel safer now that you're safely back inside the hologram? Will you go out into the sunshine and embrace consensus reality as you did before? Or will you feel like something has changed, as though things are somehow different than you remember? If you experience the latter, welcome to the universe of David Icke. I'm not sure I agree with the use of his humor in this work which I honestly did find humorous but I can say I didn't find it appropriate dealing with this subject matter giving his audience (the general public). I personally think he gives to much credit to the powers that be. Frightening, he should put these ideas on DVD to give people in power even more ideas to act upon. Most of his work has a good deal of merit although I do think he gets a little deep into things which are still theoretical, but all and all I think it should be required material for those still able to use there minds. Even if it doesn't prove a thing at least it might wake a few people up to the possibility that their lovely image of the world isn't as it appears, or at least gives them the initiative to think on there own."""

As they begin  she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun. She flees with a young marketing trainee  Ted Pikul  who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard. Unfortunately  her pod  an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the eXistenZ game program  is damaged. To inspect it  she talks Ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her. The events leading up to this  and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure where reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game's perspective.Action Sci-Fi Thriller , alternate-reality cerebral computer-game cyberpunk dreamlike existentialism futuristic original sci-fi sci-fi science-fiction scifi surreal technology video-game video-games videogame virtual-reality weird ,""Cronenberg is a genius in a way. He leads us into the world of a new generation of console games and 3D virtual reality. Everything happens the way the characters you are projected into decide, and yet your deeper psyche can influence the characters. You liberate in such a game your most sombre death instinct and psychotic tendencies. You become the character and the character becomes you. You are entirely dominated by a logic that comes from the character and from the deepest layers of your impulses and passions. You burn up yourself in such a game and you do not know any more where reality is and where you stand in it. Everything becomes both virtual and real. You are lost and unable to make a decision and get out of this virtual world which is just as real as reality. Reality disappears by being blended with virtuality. The game becomes a nightmarish experience and a psychotic trip. You use any weapon at your disposal, in the game or in reality, to kill and destroy yourself and other characters or individuals. Death is at the end of the line, death of your mind, death of your psyche, death of your individuality, death of your freedom and free choosing mind. This film is dangerous because it reveals a real danger we are confronted to : playing any game builds in you a second nature that is rooted in your most morbid passions. Dr jacques COULARDEAU A typical Cronenberg - blurred line between reality and fantasy, strange interaction between biology and technology, themes of addiciton and a psychological thriller plot. Leigh is average at best as a star game designer who is releasing a VR game so potent that people are out to kill her. Jude Law is good as the sidekick dragged into Leigh's alter world. However, as in all Cronenberg movies, he is the star and the actors are basically meaningless. Like """"Naked Lunch"""" and """"Dead Ringers"""" the sets and effects are striking and often gross. And also like those movies, Cronenberg injects biology where you would never expect it. In """"eXistenz"""" the game console is a biological creature which must interact with the player via a connection to the spinal cord - weird stuff indeed. Gamers eventually develop a strong addicition to their bio-console in a drug-like way - another common Cronenberg motif. The story is intelligent and the artistic direction is quite interesting, but this film is not for everyone. Yet another virtual-reality film, but a very different one from the Matrix, and perhaps Cronenberg's most satisfying film. Full of the director's signature polymorphous perversity, it's not for the sqeamish or for those who demand standard Hollywood pacing, explication or cinematography. This film takes risks and will be hated by some, but others will find it a fascinating exploraton of ancient philosophical issues reified by modern technology. ...a bit slow at first...actually for the first hour...but once they enter eXistenZ this is one wild ride...this film was compared to the Matrix, but this is nothing like the Matrix...it is it's own little movie with a terrific ending that blew me away... I have seen all of Cronenbergs movies, including the ones he made on filmschool, and usually I really like them (except from Crash). I'm a bit ambivalent towards this one. The concept is good, biological gaming consoles that are plugged into the spine. But the direction is a bit dull, the story doesn't get anywhere and event the usual gory-like special effects that Cronenberg likes seems a bit badly done. The gamingconsoles look too much like plastic for me. Only the teethshooting gun was a really inovative idea. The acting is adequate, nothing one is impressed by. The ending is a bit too confusing to good and its hard to keep the interest up for the whole time. I would recommend people to see Videodrome instead, or perhaps a movie by another director, like Dark City. This one is not interesting enough. This is a great entertaining movie that fans of David Cronenberg should love. The only problem is where are the extras (three commentary tracks + documentary) that are included on the Canadian and Region 2 edition of this movie? On the cover of this movie it says~""""Makes THE MATRIX Look Like Child's Play.""""~SAN FRAN. CHRONICLE.....Not even! Even though it has a somewhat clever plot/ending,it fails to deliver ANYTHING of the MATRIX! IT is a great movie.....if you watch it right before the MATRIX! An otherwise good movie,actors/scenery....A good choice! First of all, get the Canadian edition--as a previous reviewer stated, it has three separate audiocommentary tracks. It even has a documentary about the production designer, which seems to be an odd inclusion. Secondly, this is as much religious criticism as it is science fiction, and if you like both this film, although slow, is never boring. Finally, this is a film wherein the viewer sees only intriguing pieces of the puzzle rather than the whole picture. It is thought-provoking and rewards repeated viewings, and certainly worth owning. First of all, the packaging of this film compared only its special effects to The Matrix. Since this movie had no special effects, that particular claim is meaningless. Apart from the area of special effects, therefore, eXistenZ should be judged on its own merit. What might that merit be? Reading the seventy or so reviews by others was enlightening. Apparently the director, Cronenberg, has elevated protoplasm-like, revolting props to something of a trademark. While this may help viewers easily identify his movies, it doesn't make the movies themselves particularly attractive. In the Naked Lunch, he used such images to underscore an important social and psychological issue (drug addiction). ExistenZ also promised to explore an intriguing social phenomenon (preoccupation with virtual reality), but I don't think it achieved that end. The """"blurring of reality"""" theme might have served as a substitute, but again this germinal idea, instead of being nurtured and cultivated, was aimlessly tossed around and eventually crushed underfoot. Any attempts at suspense or drama produced only comic results. Take for example, the scene near the end where our hero cut his companion's """"umbilical cord"""", releasing a gush of fake blood. The """"B"""" horror movie imagery, funny enough in itself, was further heightened by the heroine's forced orgasmic groaning and the hero's pathetic cries of despair, """"I just don't know what to do."""" Then in came a third person exclaiming, """"I know what to do,"""" whereupon he began to incinerate a small, gooey creature using an enormous flame thrower. The scene came across like a Saturday Night Live skit - the whole movie, in fact, was little more than a string of such skits. One critic pointed out that the movie intended itself to be taken in a sardonic vein - something along the lines of Natural Born Killers or Boogey Nights. But these latter two were subtle and clever mockeries. EXistenz had no surrealism, no creative graphic montage, no intelligent lampooning of societal fixtures. The only possibility left is that Cronenburg intended this film as a satire on his own movie-making style. Others critics defend this movie as something that only """"some"""" can understand. Perhaps there are those who find this director's repulsive props an attraction in themselves - I certainly am not one of those. ExistenZ is the first movie I've watched in a long time that I found so wretchedly bad that it actually created some resentment on my part. I watched it because I was with a friend and wanted to be polite. As it turns out, I should have erred on the side of rudeness. I warn other viewers against the danger of spending money on what is, in my opinion, an amazingly clumsy and vacuous film. I loved every bit of this movie. I thought the idea was so original. This movie also had a great moral message that suggested that our technology would destroy the human race one day. I thought the acting was great, (Jennifer Jason Leigh rules), visually it was amazing, and I applaud everyone who had anything to do with this film. I give it 5 out of 5. Anyone who is unfamilier with David Cronenberg's work and don't know weather to purchase eXistenZ or not need only see one film... Videodrome. If you like that, you'll like eXistenZ. The plot is far too complicated to explain but beleive me, fams of the genre will not be disappointed. P.S. (for people who have seen it) Isn't the """"Bone Gun"""" amazing. It's hard to rate this movie, especially without giving away any plot spoilers (which has to do with periods of bad acting). However it's a fun ride, yet it feels as though the whole """"game world"""" wasn't as fully explored as it could have been. A few scenes, namely the """"Chinese Waiter"""" one, are fantastic, while some are boring...like the car ride in the beginning. The plot itself is pretty easy to understand once you watch the movie twice, or just pay attention the first time. This is no Matrix, and it should hardly be compared to it (I'm not saying The Matrix is good or bad: the only thing these movies have in common is the ability to link up into a fictional world). I bought this as a blind buy and was slightly dissapointed...especially after watching Crash. Check out Equilibrium as well. Have you read Ian Watson's Deathhunter? It took me a while to make the link, but now I know why I didn't like eXistenZ that much. It's just been done better before. Watson similarly deals with virtual reality and the blurring of it and reality. He also has a similar cop-out ending. Only he's more imaginative than Cronenberg. eXistenZ is an """"interesting"""" movie. Blurring the lines between reality and fiction, not knowing what is real and what is not, can be an effective way to introduce suspense. eXistenZ doesn't manage that fully. It remains an interesting ride, but never really takes off. It slowly introduces us to an interesting world, but just as we get to understand it better, it suddenly ends. There is no real closure, and the movie left me with a feeling that David Cronenberg just wanted to confuse me. The ending seems like a cop-out - although a predictable one. It is a little thought provocative, but mainly in that you have to think real hard to make sense of it. Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is not easy to like or identify with, which didn't help. All in all, it's a movie that you can afford to miss. Star Trek: The Next Generation had a better episode that dealt with uncertainty about the real reality (and I'm not that great a fan of ST:TNG), and, as I said before, Ian Watson also did it better (not that his book was perfect). But eXistenZ could probably be adapted to a nice TV series. The DVD is also nothing special. You get the usual scene selection and theatrical trailer, and the really pathetic """"film recommendations"""". The latter shows you pictures of the covers of six other films that you might like to see. Pictures! Static pictures! You'd think that someone with half the brain would have put the trailers for these movies on the disc (it's not like it's crammed too tight with material). But no, they had to put just pictures! Sorry, got carried away a little. It's just that this really is the most pathetic DVD feature I've ever seen. Final comment: After reading some of the customer reviews, I removed the obvious comparison to The Matrix. They really are too different, execpt for the subject of virtual reality. However, The Matrix was a well done action film, and a really well done DVD. eXistenZ is just okay. I have nothing against the acting or the gore or the effects, but if you want a really imaginative and funny movie that blurs reality, see Being John Malkovich. 'Existenz' has"""	eXistenZ

""""La Femme Nikita"""" is a classic and needs no more explaining by me. Both of these movies are entertaining in their own ways. Run Lola Run has one of the worst English dubs I've ever heard. The voices are terrible, and actually painful to listen to. So, I struggled through with my limited German language capabilities, and subtitles. Still worth it. Nikita was fine, all around. (still, avoid the English dub though) A worthwhile purchase, regardless of the inconveniences. The Two-Pack Blu-ray of La Femme Nikita and Run Lola Run isn't for everyone. La Femme Nikita, directed by Luc Besson was a disappointment. I love Mr. Besson's work including some of my all-time favorites like """"The Fifth Element"""", """"Wasabi"""", """"From Paris with Love"""" and others. The film also has some of my favorite French actors like Jean Reno and Anne Parillaud. Unfortunately, unless you speak French, the dubbed version leaves a lot to be desired. The translation from French to English was horrendous. The American version, """"Point of No Return"""" with Bridget Fonda was much better. I give this film only two stars. Run Lola Run is a good film if you have a taste for quirky foreign films. When I first saw the film 10 or more years ago, it was the first time I saw Franka Potente. She had an immediate effect on me. By the time she starred in the Bourne films, I was already a fan. Keep in mind that this film has some strange animation woven into the action and the action itself is almost non-stop and frenetic. All in all, the film is worth watching. I give this film four stars, which makes it a three star rating for the two pack. My recommendation, buy Run Lola Run and forget La Femme Nikita. It's not worth the cost of the blu-ray, even with the discount. Excellent. Real tough ladies in tough roles-Beeson likes his female leads, if he doesn't marry them he promotes their careers. Usually, collection have one good movie, and one fluff piece they're trying to unload from their inventory. Not here. Both the original La Femme Nikita and Run Lola run are brilliant films. It may be the best adrenaline filled double-feature led by female actors. The fact they aren't both action stars are shameful, as they carry these classics."""	Run Lola Run Lola rennt

Lester's infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life  where he openly doesn't care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does  anyone except Angela. This infatuation coincides with the Fittses moving in next door: homophobic disciplinarian US Marine Colonel Frank Fitts who rules the house with a military fist (that fist being both figurative and literal)  his semi comatose wife Barbara Fitts  and their bright and quietly subversive eighteen year old son Ricky Fitts  who openly abides by his father's rules while behind the scenes lives by his own quite different perspective. Much like Lester's infatuation  Ricky immediately becomes infatuated with Janie  he who considers girls like Angela as ordinary. The entry of Angela and the Fittses into the Burnhams' lives ultimately leads to each of the players confronting what is truly in his or her heart.Comedy Drama , adultery artsy beautiful beautifully-filmed bittersweet cerebral character-study cinematography coming-of-age complex cult-classic cynical dark dark-comedy dark-humor depression drama dramatic dreams drugs dysfunctional-family emotional excellent-script exceptional-acting existentialism good good-acting good-soundtrack great-acting great-ending great-movie honest imdb-top-250 intellectual interesting life life-&-death life-philosophy loneliness masterpiece melancholic mentor midlife-crisis narrated nudity-(topless---notable) obsession original oscar oscar-(best-actor) oscar-(best-actress) oscar-(best-cinematography) oscar-(best-directing) oscar-(best-editing) oscar-(best-picture) oscar-(best-supporting-actor) oscar-winner parenthood passionate philosophy poignant powerful-ending realistic redemption reflective relationships satirical sexuality social-commentary special story storytelling suburbia thought-provoking violence visually-appealing visually-stunning weird ,""love Kevin Spacey Loved this movie.. Terrible film, worst movie to ever win best picture. Can watch this movie again and again! Nostalgic, funny, insightful, Sad! Loved ALL the characters! Kevin Spacey working at the Fast Food Restaurant has me laughing the entire time! Great movie and very well put together. Kevin Spacey is his usual awesome self. Fast delivery, enjoyed the movie very much, all time classic. Thanks! Quintessential Kevin Spacy. In a typical suburban American neighborhood, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is an average, middle-aged man. However, he is currently living a depressing existence. He works at an unfulfilling job, is in a loveless marriage with his vain and materialistic wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), and his daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), absolutely despises him. While at a high school basketball game to see Jane cheerleading, he sees her teenaged friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and immediately becomes infatuated with her. Meanwhile, a bigoted Marine veteran, Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), moves next door with his secretive drug dealing son Ricky (Wes Bentley), who starts to stalk Jane. This is a very thought-provoking movie that is also darkly comedic at times. Watching this film makes you think about life and what people really want out of it and the sometimes ridiculous false facades we put up in the process. Of special note is Kevin Spacey as the lead character who does nothing short of an excellent job in the role which earned him a well-deserved Oscar for best actor. Besides Spacey, everyone does a good performance in the movie as well. The cinematography is also well done with a great musical score to boot. The only real negative I can think of is that it does get a little pretentious at times. I thought the famous plastic bag scene was a little over-the-top. This Blu-ray includes as bonus features a commentary track and some behind-the-scenes features. This is an interesting movie that I would recommend to anyone that likes a thought-provoking film. Good movie good seller Good the second time around too Everyone else giving it a 5 is right American beauty is one of the best movies it's in the top 10 at least. Best film of the year Classic movie, food price Absolutely brilliant. My highest recommendation. My favorite movie of all time. Kevin Spacey plays the everyman with only one difference: He is honest with himself. Which makes for a fanciful ride and a voyeur's delight. Great product , purchase , and seller!! Excellent buy!! A classic. Must see. I hadn't seen it until 2015. Pretty timeless movie. Only unrealistic part is that no guy would have ever said no to the hottie. Other than that I loved it. Great movie; excellent Blu-ray transfer! I love this movie, and return to it from time to time. Kevin Spacey is brilliant. This movie makes you think no matter your gender, age, or life situation. It is very symbolic and super deep. Good Kevin Spacey movie-if your 40+ , your know how he feels and appreciate the story. A dark comedy that isn't exactly funny, but rather, a satire of modern American life that jerks you out of your complacency & makes you see everything in a different light. Powerful, thought-provoking, sometimes surreal, this movie might make you a bit uncomfortable at times, but when it's over you're glad you saw it. Unlike many Hollywood films, this movie is totally character-driven & the characters are complex & multidimensional, very flawed but understandable. Fine acting by a great cast that includes Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Chris Cooper, et al. Well worth seeing. love it Nothing needs to be said. Awesome movie that really messes with your head Where do I begin? To be honest, when I was finished watching this film, I wasn't sure what to make of it. But, after some thinking, I realized that there are some subtly beautiful moments in this film, despite the cynical tone. """"American Beauty"""" is the 1999 directorial debut of Sam Mendes, who would later go on to direct """"Road to Perdition"""" and """"Skyfall."""" The plot is a little difficult to describes as there are several storylines going on throughout the film. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) live a seemingly normal, happy life in suburbia. However, there is trouble in paradise. Lester is sexually infatuated with Jane's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), Carolyn is incessantly materialistic and having an affair with a rival real estate agent, and Jane hates both of her parents and has poor self-image. Things start to change when the new neighbors move in. That's all I will say about the plot as I don't want to give away too much about the story. This film was considered the best reviewed film of 1999 and for good reason. Everything about this film is great. The acting, direction, script, production design, and cinematography are all superb. Kudos to Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening for their lead performances. Sam Mendes, who had been a theatre director before this film, shows amazing artistic flair, especially with the surreal fantasy sequences. The script, by """"True Blood"""" creator Alan Ball, is witty, beautiful, and sometimes sad. Also, the score by Thomas Newman is superb and one of the most instantly recognizable musical themes in film. The only criticism I will give this film is that sometimes the film got a little mixed up with what the overall theme was. Some perceive it as a film about the meaning of life, and others perceive it an inside look of what American suburbia really looks like. It is up to the viewer to decide what to think. I know, the plot seems incredibly dreary. But if you give this film a chance you will see that, in the words of Lester, """"There is so much beauty in the world."""" Another of the famed Sapphire series of blurays that went to the cellar for whatever they did here and came up with garbage. An old master, a sharpened and harsh image, yadda yadda. If it's your favorite film it may be worth 5 bucks, but I'll hold out for something better. The film is a masterpiece, but much like Gladiator, which actually had a reissue because of the massive campaign against its awful first release, this one just looks like a rushed product not fit for release. It deserves so much better. always enjoyed the movie when came out and is a movie you can sink into being part of it. fantastic film an okay movie An absolutely wonderful drama from start to finish. This is a fantastic movie that I thoroughly enjoyed, highly recommended! American Beauty had such a massive impact on popular art-cinema that at times it seems a bit of a clich. It has the weird depressed artistic kid, the self-help infatuated business people, the hyper-sexualised blonde girl, the emasculated dad, the evil corporate boss, and the repressed homophobic military man. Yet, I think the feeling of clich that can affect the viewer of this movie is mostly the result of the influence it had on how the disaffection of modern American culture was portrayed in the television shows and movies that followed rather than due to an inherent flaw in the movie. This is a movie about the meaninglessness of modern American life. It shows the breakdown of the family unit, where all family members are against each other in a domestic cold-war. Individuals working in companies are treated without respect and do not feel any purpose and hence motivation to perform their job well. Those that do feel passion for their work do so out of a lack of true self-esteem and embrace a self-help, Tony Robbins type culture that comes across as extremely odious to those that see through the mask of professionalism. Youth are depressed and disconnected from their parents; those that have a more creative streak are out casted by materialistis in the school system and readily engage in devious behaviour. Old school Americans feel lost in a system that no longer respects toughness and stoicism but are unable to embrace the emotional and sexual liberalism of the modern world. American Beauty attempts to capture the malaise of modern America and provides somewhat extreme versions of the different manifestations that this takes. Watching this movie I was struck by the fact that every character in this movie was white and middle-class. In this sense, American Beauty is limited by the fact that it is a presentation of the ills only affecting a small and privileged group within a wealthy, developed country. This fact could be viewed as reflecting the fundamental immaturity of the individuals portrayed as they are not able to enjoy their privilege. On the other hand, suffering is always subjective, and all humans face pain in their own way, framed by the circumstances that shape their lives. It therefore displays the confusion and absurdity of a very specific social class, but does not act as a more robust statement on humanity as a whole. One key point in American Beauty is the role of sexuality. Individuals are shown to seek refuge from their lives through sex: both fantasy and real. The movie displays the futility of this approach. The fantasy either will not meet our expectations, or will die off into another form of boredom or pain. There is no real redemptive quality to this message: no one seems to transcend it or come to terms with the reality of it. Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, seems to encounter this head-on later in the movie, but this experience hardly plays an important role in the development of his life or character nor of the movie. The weakness of the movie lays in its beginning and conclusion, which both involve Lester speaking of his past life as if in some kind of afterlife. This is the narrative technique used, but is not properly incorporated into the rest of the movie or explained. Possibly the movie was saying that the foolishness of life is only fully seen by those that have ceased living, or that there is some kind of religious meaning to all the suffering that plays out in human life. However, it has the feeling of something tacked onto the movie without much reflection on what it is meant to portray. Finally, the bleakness of the message is made viewer friendly due to the fine work of the director, Sam Mendes. It is shot in a soft, playful and stylistically lush way. The colours are bright and the movie is upbeat. All of this led to the huge popularity of this movie as while presenting a harsh message, American Beauty is an enjoyable, playful and humorous film. See my other reviews at amateurreviewspace.blotspot.com Not my style. Unhappy movie. I know this is a fantastic movie in beautifully constructed by the same mind who gave us """"true blood"""" and """"six feet under"""" so do not hesitate to check out this brilliant gem. I'TS GOOD I understand people consider this a classic movie. It brings up some very intersting questions and points out what some couples have to struggle with in their marriage: kids, unfaithful spouse, drugs, peer pressure, workplace competition, etc. I personally think it was a good movie, but not educational in any way, the choices made by the characters in the movie however might be representing what the majority of people do these days, but definitely not my cup of tea. I love the movie. A sort of Spacey classic. Believable American family story. I don't wanna review this cause I will probly give it away. Great film Awesome movie. Great controversial material Twisted and very accurate black comedy on our society and social culture. Kevin is brilliant. It is a Powerful Movie, always enjoy it. Shows us what can happen, or be hidden behind the trimmed lawns and gorgeous closed doors of suburbia. Beautifully filmed and open to many"""

A good story turned into a weekday movie that fails on so many fronts. The Gov. of Cali does about as well as you could possible expect, so don't blame the failure on him, or on the story, it is just a C production. Cool movie!!! It arrived on time and in great condition. It played well and enjoyed it. Thank you. Good movie Though I've read a fair bit of Philip K. Dick, whose short story """"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"""" was adapted by a whole mess of people for this 1990 Paul Verhoeven film, I've neither read this piece nor any others that have been adapted into film. Strange, eh? So I come at this, as I did on first seeing it new 20 years ago, knowing a bit about the basic ideas behind it and most of Dick's fiction, but without being able to comment too much on the work as an adaptation. Perhaps that's for the best; I doubt Dick would have approved of any of his work being turned into an Arnie slugfest; then again, on a second viewing and watched carefully, there's definitely more than meets the eye. First off, not surprisingly if you're familiar with the author at all, this is a story about identity and the nature of reality. Douglas Quaid (Arnie) is a construction worker on Earth in 2048 who keeps having nightmares about Mars. His wife Lori (Sharon Stone) worries about him and tries to keep his mind off these regular dreams, but to no avail. Quaid decides to visit """"Rekall"""", a company that provides dream vacations that can be implanted into your memories directly, giving a sensation every bit as real as if you'd actually taken the physical trip. Or so they claim. But something goes wrong as Quaid is strapped into the chair, waiting for his dream of being a secret agent on Mars to begin. He starts convulsing and going nuts, and soon he is sedated and dropped in a cab to be sent home. Now his real nightmare begins, as first his best friend from work (Robert Costanzo) tries to kill him, followed by his wife - who claims she's an agent sent to monitor him. Turns out that Mr. Quaid really was an agent on Mars, and he's had his memory wiped and a new persona created by Cohagen, the director of the Mars colony, a ruthless dictator type played by (who else) Ronny Cox. Soon Cohagen's chief henchman Richter (Michael Ironside) and a crew are out to bring Quaid in, and Quaid is on the run through the antiseptic city, and then on to the domes of Mars where he works to find out the secrets that Cohagen is trying to surpress. Though the """"is this real or is it a dream"""" theme does recur at various times in the film and is always an uneasy current running through most of the narrative, at heart Total Recall is a non-stop action/thriller, and a pretty solid one overall. The ace supporting cast, which also includes Rachel Ticotin as an apparent former lover of the amnesiac Quaid on Mars and Mel Johnson Jr as a wisecracking cab driver, manages to outshine our hero on many occasions, which is fine as Arnold's physical presence isn't really as important here as it usually is. This is clearly a role that could have been readily adapted for any number of actors (Patrick Swayze was one of those considered for it at one time), but Arnold's stardom helped get it made, and helped raise a budget that allowed for some fairly impressive sets and effects. The look of the film is industrial and at times antiseptic, and in fact it may look pretty cheap if you're used to the high-gloss sheen of most new big-budget action films, but it serves Verhoeven's purpose of showing a future-world in which the have-nots still seemingly far outnumber the haves, and the lives of the lower classes aren't worth a hill of beans to the few ruthless men in charge. There's less room for the director's typically satirical and jaundiced vision here, but it's certainly not missing. Ultimately the big climactic last few sequences ring just a little hollow to me and the last scene in particular is just silly as hell. But Arnold's last line and a few other touches here and there do help to remind us that we may be in a dream the whole time, and who would want to dream of saving the world in a prosaic, ordinary, believable way? Another spectacularly good and original score by Jerry Goldsmith here; the man could practically do no wrong as far as I've been able to tell. The """"making of/behind the scenes"""" feature here is one of the better examples I've seen; this comes very, very close to being deserving of a """"5"""" from me, but sometimes the flaws need as much recognition as the merits. In any case, among Arnold's 5 or so best films I think, and I'm sure I'll return to it again in less than 20 years this time. gift i decided a few years ago, i am not investing in a blu ray player until the technology is completely perfected like dvd. the blu ray players are too expensive the dvd requires a """"tranfer (conversion) process"""""""" which means the manufacturing is only a step above public domain (like the old school vhs """"for collectors only"""" underground """"grey-market"""" which is now primarily dvd only) which is still a risky gamble. though a few movies i have been wanting, are exclusive to blu ray. i have chosen to live without them. still there are occasions when i still run back to vhs and when i can find them,laserdiscs. i won't own umd for the psp nor will i own (if the format is real IN JAPAN) the dvd-rom format for movies. Of course this comment is coming from a sci-fi lover, the sci-fi and Arnold was great. It didn't hurt to see Sharon Stone either. I have watched it several times. Arnold plays one of his best roles I think in this one. Science fiction is in many ways unpredictable. This film is a lot better than I remembered it. It plays on reality and virtuality, on recollection and fantasy, on what is true and what is maybe true or untrue. That game is at times surprising because there is no solution to a real illusion or a false reality. Mars is a paradise for mining corporations that have total and free hands to do ,what they want, which means exploit those who work, do not control environmental conditions so that more and more mutants appear that are trapped in some zones where they can survive if they manage to bring in some income through gambling or prostitution. The new slaves of this future world, free slaves that can die by a simple decision of the boss of the planet, the boss of the main mining corporation: just cut their air and they die. Beyond that it would be spoilers and spoilers, but what is interesting is that the danger this world is obliged to face is the greed for money of course but also for power of those who are supposed to manage the planet. The danger is not outside once again but inside, inside the system that uses free enterprise to be competitive, to the point we may wonder if these films are not speaking for public control of these natural resources. And yet they are not because public control of natural resources remove any possible choice and competition and then corruption is dominant. We can note that this film does not show any political personnel and we can wonder if that is not a picture of sovietism, the good old but dead thanks God sovietism where the political personnel had full control of the economy of the country, which destroyed the system eventually because they maybe were good authoritarian of not tyrannical politicians but they were null economists. The second element is that some extraterrestrials or aliens had come to the planet before terrestrial humans and had found and built the solution to produce oxygen and an atmosphere by melting the underground ice and breaking it up into gases, Oxygen and Hydrogen, but the most lucrative commerce on Mars is the sale of air, so you can imagine this alien invention and technology is banned. But once again the danger is not outside, in fact the solution and salvation are coming from these aliens. Once again, many people considered in the 1980s these films were Cold War films justifying the capitalist system and encouraging all kinds of segregation. And today we are able to look at these films with different eyes. Of course they are entertaining films but their ideological meaning is more mixed, ambiguous and I would say that the main fink, traitor is a mutant, black what's more though the salvation comes from a strange mutant as the main leader and many others who finally find some courage to oppose the mining establishment. It is this ambiguity that probably makes these films more durable than John Wayne's westerns that are all openly racist and segregative and in no way open to any criticism of the colonial system that ethnically cleansed the Indians to let a wild jungle take over that John Wayne tries to idealize and make shiny and bright, admirable in one word. I love gangsters but I can't help it I prefer those who get them down, especially when the gangsters are on the side of the law: corruption, you say? Jacques COULARDEAU Saw in in a movie theatre. The story got so convoluted and complex, it was difficult to follow what was going on. Also completely over-done with absurd, trashy special effects and violence. Good You have to know what you're getting into with a film like `Total Recall'. My guess is that you do. If you pick a DVD with the name Schwarzenegger in bold letters at the top then you know that the talent level is very low, but it will be explosive and entertaining. `Total Recall' is just that. The acting and plotting and general storytelling aspects of this film are marginally successful, with moments of full blown ridiculousness, but the film is exciting in all the right areas and it maintains a level of cleverness that will keep you glued. The graphics are top notch (if not a tad on the cheesy side at times) for the time period in which this was made, and the action sequences are all pretty fun. As far as the story is concerned, well a lot of Arnold's films seemed to be cut from the same mold, and this is no different. Still, if you have a lazy Sunday afternoon prepared for it, `Total Recall' can bring with it a fairly good time. This is the best print of the film yet; even the DVD render looks washed out and grainy by comparison. The audio track is strangely quiet though. Great dynamics in the mix- gunfire is punchy and loud while Mars dust underfoot is soft- but the title theme sounds unusually quiet. The menus have a nice snap to them and are laid out efficiently. Featurettes include a brand new Paul Verhoeven interview with a couple nifty documentaries thrown in AND a commentary track with Arnie and Verhoeven. As far as the film is considered, it has only improved with age, with Ronnie Cox portraying a money hungry corporate overlord I'm sure many of us could imagine sitting in Washington or Silicon Valley today. It's also great to see Arnie kicking ass while in his prime. Another thing I think really makes Total Recall hold up is that it's not a film which would ever be made today, and is all the more refreshing to watch for that reason. Excellent movie wanted"""	Total Recall

Cher has had a hugely successful career in music; she was well-known with Sonny, but it was her solo career that seemed more successful. But Cher wasn't about to be successful in just the music business; Cher wanted to be successful as an actress as well. Cher has starred in a wide load of movies, such as 'Chastity', where she played the title role, 'Silkwood', where she played Dolly Pelliker, 'Mask', where she played Florence 'Rusty' Dennis, 'Suspect', where she played Kathleen Riley, 'The Witches Of Eastwick', where she played Alexandra Medford, etc. But it was her role as Loretta Castorini in the romantic comedy, 'Moonstruck' that made her another one of today's best actresses. Taking place in New York City in 1987, Cher playes Loretta Castorini, a lonely Italian widow, who is longing for her Prince Charming to sweep her up off her legs and get her out of her misery. Loretta goes to dinner with her best friend, Johnny Cammareri (played by Danny Aiello). Johnny surprisingly proposes to Loretta, and she happily accepts. Although Loretta likes Johnny a lot because he is her best friend, she knows for a fact that she does not love him. After dinner, Loretta drives Johnny to the airport, for he is flying to Sicilly to be by the side of his dying mother. Before he boards the plane, Johnny gives Loretta the number to his brother's place, and tells her to invite his brother to the wedding. The two lived their lives without seeing or speaking to each other for five years, due to an accident. Loretta assures Johnny that she'll do so and goes home to tell her mother and father, Rose and Cosmo Castorini (played by Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia). Loretta wakes up the next morning, with a phone call from Johnny, asking if Loretta had called his brother yet. Loretta informs Johnny that she'll do so when she hangs up with Johnny. She calles Johnny's brother, but his brother sounds very bitter about Johnny getting married first. Loretta walks down to where Johnny's brother works. Ronny Cammareri is Johnny's brother and he works in a little bread factory, who is still miserable after losing his hand in a bread chopper. He feels Johnny was responsible since, Ronny was using the chopper to chop up some bread for Johnny. Loretta takes Ronny back to his place and begins to explain the truth to Johnny's misery. But the two wind up sleeping together. The next morning, Loretta wakes up the next morning only to find Ronny by her side and flips out. She realizes that what she did was wrong, for she is still engaged to Johnny. But Ronny finds himself having fallen madly in love with Loretta... literally. Ronny invites Loretta to the opera, telling her that he loves her dearly and loves the opera dearly. He then says that if he could be with the woman he loves for one more night and to spend the night with the woman he loves by attending a show he loves dearly, he would promise not to bother Loretta again. Loretta goes to the Met, where she meets up with Ronny. The two sit through the opera, very much enjoying the show. Loretta seemed to have enjoyed very much, until she finds her father with a woman and that woman is not her mother. Ronny and Loretta go back to Ronny's place. Loretta does not want to be unfaithful, since she has been unfaithful to Johnny already once. But she knows that she does not love Johnny, for she is madly in love with Ronny and, for the first time, really sees that Ronny is love with her. Will Loretta leave Johnny for Ronny, or will she stay with Johnny? Watch this classic romantic comedy and you'll find out. Excellent Blessings in Holy Sound-Yeshua.... The VCR tape is still working well after being mfg. many yrs. ago.... Thanks ! Namaste, Omody Very satisfied Quit bellyachin' about the pan-and-scan format, stick to the story. If anybody exists who can watch this movie and not fall in love with it, I hope I never meet them. Cher is absolutely marvelous in this timeless comedy about a frumpy widow who is about to re-marry for convenience instead of love; her intended is an overgrown mama's boy who looks like he just swallowed a dose of cyanide when he proposes to her. Off he runs to Italy to visit his mother on her deathbed; while he's away, Cher meets his estranged brother who literally and figuratively sweeps her off her feet. Meanwhile, her dad is going through a delayed midlife crisis and is cheating on her mother. (There's a priceless scene when Cher and her future brother-in-law run into her dad and his mistress at the opera, it's hard to tell who's the more outraged, Cher or Dad. Dad: """"You're engaged!"""" Cher: """"and you're married!"""") Both messes get sorted out satisfactorily; Cher's intended decides he can't marry her after all, leaving her free to marry his brother, for love; and dad drops his mistress and returns to mom. It's a delightful romp of a movie and everybody seems to have a ball acting in it. Bookending the whole film is Dean Martin's rendition of """"That's Amore"""", making me wonder for the umpteemth time... what the heck IS pasta fazool? I absolutely adore this movie. Every time I see this movie I laugh out loud it is so funny. I love the grandfather and his five dogs who howl at the moon mainly because I am a huge dog lover. Actually, in some ways the grandfather is my favorite character, he is only around for comic relief, but he really makes me laugh almost every time he is in a scene, especially in a very tense moment at almost the very end of the movie where no one is talking, and he says: """"Someone tell a joke."""" I love how this movie is like a snapshot of a traditional type Italian family. Italian is a beautiful sounding language and, even though I have almost no idea what the words mean, I love listening to the characters talk in Italian. Luna is a much more beautiful sounding word than moon. I love Olymphia Dukakis in the role of the mother; she is just wonderful. Nicholas Cage is a mad man in this movie-but his character is hilarious. My favorite scene with him is after the opera where he is trying to convince Loretta that she should chose him over his brother. The arguments that he uses are both logical and illogical at the same time. I love it when Loretta (Cher) describes Ronny (Cage) as the wolf who chewed off his own hand to escape the trap of loving the wrong woman--because Ronny is a very wolfish-like character. The only other movie I have seen with Cher in it is Mask. She did just as good, if not better, in this comedic role as she did in her dramatic role in Mask. This really is my all time favorite movie, every time I watch it I feel like I love it more than I did the last time I watched it. Okay, I am of Italian descent and originally from Brooklyn, so I can say that it is quite a realistic portrayal of that American subculture. But that aside, I found this movie wonderfully uplifting. I saw it in Copenhagen, subtitled in Danish (which I can speak and read)and it was a riot to see how they translated Italian-American Brooklyn English into a foreign language (didn't work too well!!!)Anyway, this movie will give you a lift anytime. Cheers for Cher, she did a marvelous job. As did Nick Cage. This film stands head and shoulders above all cinematic romantic comedies. It is virtually flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is captivatingly delightful! Every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles -- Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. For many of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film. I've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can deflate the impact of a film substantially. More tellingly, I realized some years ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted. I agree with the reviewer who raves about the scene depicting original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters. But there are so many others that have stunning impact -- Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: """"Don't sh-t where you eat!""""; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage """"taking"""" Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background! There are many great romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart/William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; The Apartment. None holds a candle to Moonstruck! This movie doesn't have to be driven by gags and star hype to get to the end. A tremendous script and great performances by supporting actors rounds out Cher and Cages' acting. The side stories of parental discord and search for romance complement the central love story. Vincent Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis were superb in their roles. The wave of chaos -brought by the moon- into all of these people's lives is marvelously written into parallel stories. The release of tension at the resolution is such a palpable relief for everyone that its almost a euphoric moment, especially for the viewer. This is a very funny romance. A widow approaching middle age and living with her parents in Brooklyn, accepts a proposal from a boring, but reliable man. He goes back to Sicily to tell his dying mother about it. She is charged with telling his estranged (and Strange) brother about it. They instantly fall in love. She refuses to end her betrothal, but agrees to go to the opera with him. In between, her family causes confusion. This movie is very funny and the cast couldn't be better. Although it helps if you are Italian and come from Brooklyn, the movie appeals to everyone and I find myself watching it again and again. This movie is simply wondeful. I have seen it more times than I can begin to count, and I still cannot find a single fault in it. The acting is superb from all angles - from the actors in the fore-front to extras with only three lines EVERYONE comes across perfectly and realistic. The plot is well-written and executed, and the soundtrack works seamlessly with the action. The best part is that it no matter how many times you see it, this movie will continue to be as enjoyable as the first time. In fact, I think I love it more with every viewing. It may help to be from an Italian family like I am - because only then can you see just how realistic the characters are. I could point to every one of them and give them a real-life counterpart. But even if you aren't you will appreciate it for its brilliance. This is one of"""	Moonstruck
8533	During the mid nineteenth century  Jeremiah Johnson  after a stint in the US Army  decides that he would prefer a life of solitude and more importantly peace by living with nature in the mountains of the frontier of the American west. This plan entails finding a piece of land upon which to build a house. This quest ends up being not quite what he envisioned as he does require the assistance of others to find his footing  and in turn he amasses friends and acquaintances along the way  some who become more a part of his life than he would have imagined. Perhaps most importantly  some of those people provide him with the knowledge of how to co exist with some of the many Indian tribes  most importantly the Crow  on whose land in Colorado Jeremiah ultimately decides to build his home. But an act by Jeremiah upon a request by the US Cavalry leads to a chain of events that may forever change the peaceful relationship he worked so hard to achieve with his neighbors and their land.Western , beautiful-scenery beautifully-filmed bleak cinematography culture-clash great great-movie harsh imdb-top-250 indians loneliness mentor native-americans original reflective scenic solitude survival vengeance visceral wilderness ,	Jeremiah Johnson
8556	"""1969. Dr. Malcolm Sayer is hired as a clinical physician at a psychiatric hospital in the Bronx  despite he only having a research background. The job is not ideal on his side as he has difficulties relating to people which is the reason he has focused on research projects not involving human subjects  while the hospital hires him somewhat out of desperation in not finding anyone else with the qualifications who wants the job. Most of his patients are in a semi catatonic state and are housed in what some of the orderlies coin the """"garden"""" ward  where all they can do for the patients is water and feed them. He notices that some of the patients  despite their generally catatonic state  respond in unusual ways to certain stimuli. In doing some research  he also finds that some common bonds between these patients are that they suffered from encephalitis in the 1920s or 1930s  and that their physical states are like they have Parkinson's disease frozen in time. As such  he is able to convince  albeit reluctantly  his skeptical boss  Dr. Kaufman  to administer an expensive experimental drug therapy on only one patient with family consent. That patient is forty one year old Leonard Lowe  who has been in his current state since he was eleven years old  and who has been supported by his loving mother through all these years. As the drug therapy """"awakens"""" Leonard  there are several issues that come into play. Malcolm has to try and convince Kaufman and the hospital administration to extend the therapy to the other patients. Despite not knowing the long term effects  Leonard  who was aware of his surroundings through his catatonic state  may have mixed emotions about his situation  wanting both to be treated as human being and an experiment guinea pig to ensure that what is happening benefits him and others in the long run. Mrs. Lowe may be unprepared for the new Leonard  she expecting who she remembers as a sweet eleven year old boy. Through all these issues  what may be the most illuminating issue for Malcolm is the need to stimulate the human spirit  including his own in dealing with people around him.

Two of Williams off beat but excellent films. True they are not Good Will Hunting or Dead Poet Society, but solid none the less. Also give a shot to What Dreams May Come. Enjoy. Two great Robin Williams films! As someone who works with people with PTSD, I love the kindness shown in The Fisher King. It is priceless. Miss this guy love the movie. just enough going on to entertain you through the whole thing Fine Awakenings should have won more and more awards. The FisherKing was a tour de force. Great! Awakenings where Williams works with mentally troubled & psychologically challenged individuals with many quirks & personalities.......and Robin Williams as their guide, caretaker, and nuturing surrogate father & guardian The Fisher King - were Jeff Bridges is a troubled soul --- frustrated with the state of world & lack of caring.....is councilled and treated by his psychiatrist to overcome tragedy, loss, and yearning to become whole again - and to fit in to the world. Love Robin Williams This film is so good! Deniro & Williams had great chemistry. I can't believe I never heard of it or seen it before. Also, never hearing the true back story or book behind it. very good Good Excellent Good product. Fair price. Like free shipping. good deal I love these two movies. Both have very deep spiritual meanings, especially the Fisher King. Great actor added these movies to our library of Robin Williams. RIP Robin Williams. You were the best and when my kids grow up I'll introduce the grandchildren to you as well. Great movies & speedy time of receipt! The Fisher King is one of the best movies I have seem and the best of Robin Williams. Came fairly quickly. I am pleased. Would definitely order again - came on time perfect condition - Great movies - when movies were worth paying for!! Good movies. I love Robin Williams humor, but these 2 movies have a more serious tone. Not that they are bad, but they are not what I wanted. Two of his greatest movies. I loved """"Awakenings,"""" but I must say that if you want to see the full range of what Robin Williams can do, you've got to see """"The Fisher King."""" A tour de force! Love it. Perfect addition to my daughter's Robin Williams DVD collection... thx I have all the Robin Williams movies on VHS, now converting so I can have my own private memorial of him. Rest in Peace Robin. I loved this one, awesome movie..NEED SEE THIS ONE.... Two of Robin WIlliams' great dramas. great videos. How can you miss with Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges and DeNiro. Really. Fast delivery, nicely packaged, exact;y what I wanted. The Fisher King is, in my humble opinion, Robin's best dramatic performance but the movie is difficult to watch; it's a harsh reality and has a turn that is both revealing and oh so hard to see. Still, a great movie. Awakening, based upon a true story, is a gem all it's own. More serious than many of his movies, it is still a great film; hear-wrenching and hopeful. Robin's Legacy If you like Robin Williams, you will love these two movies. Both are very entertaining and Awakenings is based on a true story much like Patch Adams which Robin Williams also stars in. 100% Recommend these movies for your collection!! You will NOT be disappointed!! Enjoyed the CD. I was going to give to my hard of hearing Mom, but the first movie, Awakenings, does NOT have subtitles (closed captions). The Fisher King *does.* Also, I could swear a tiny snipped of Awakenings was edited out as I remember a line from the movie seen on TV that is not on the CD. But this is little stuff I'm complaining about.... these are both very good movies. Great as always Great movie Two of the most wonderful films I have seen! One of Robins best! Awesome, outstanding movies. Highly recommended. Great acting by Robin Williams. Great movie. Two very fine films with Robin Williams. Bought after his death. Must see Quick response - thanks! Enjoyed the movies. can't go wrong with a double feature.. the best comedian to watch. Loved both of them. Two fenomenal classics great Fast ship good movie good price only awakenings .that was very very good. i did not like the fisher king Awakenings was good. The Fisher King was OK. grea Great double feature. What a treat for Robin Williams fans. Love Robin Williams! great movies I have watched these movies many times before purchasing them and just had to have them for my own. Not only because Robin Williams will not be entertaining us anymore, but because there are awesome messages in these movies. Since I have a terminal illness, movies and audiobooks are my prime source of entertainment and these are """"feel good"""" movies. Everyone should see them. Great seller and very fast delivery. Thank you. we will miss Robin Williams forever must remember Robin at his best Robin Williams in some of his finest work! WHAT A LOSS, I'LL MISS YOU ROBIN Both movies are worth owning. I am surprised it's so cheap. <3 What can I say? Both of these movies are phenemonal. In Awakenings, Robert DeNiro does such as good job of portraying a person with his illness. He just wants to be treated with dignity. The other patients in the hospital each have their endearing qualities as well. Robert speaks up for the other patients. Robin Williams does a great job portraying the doctor who only wants to help the patients. He wants what is best for them and he wants them to live a full life. Robin plays the part perfectly with compassion and dedication regarding his patients. When his experimental drug seems to fail, he is heartbroken. The Fisher King will break your heart as Robin's character has been through so much and yet he is so tender. Jeff Bridges character goes from being on top of the world as a popular DJ to becoming a video store clerk living with the store's owner. The movie follows the two characters and how their lives intersect and the struggles they both live with every day. Jeff's character is not very lovable at first. He softens as he spends more time with Robin. At the end it hard to say who saved who. I say they saved each other. These two movies are a must have for any Robin Williams fans. I for one like movies where Robin can show the depth of his acting abilities instead of just playing the funny, crazy guy. fisher king 10 out of 10 - no other words needed i''ll miss this guy arrived perfect"""	Awakenings

Watching any one of these movies (w/o the TV commercials) is a personal event. Howard allows you to live through the characters...with some suspense thrown in. The quality of the multipack is excellent, it is well presented and has eight DVD's, two for each film. The extra packs and special features are the type and quality normally found on 19.99+ original release editions. The packaging of the group as a whole is far superior to normal multipacks containing double sided discs in a cheap plastic sleeve. It makes an excellent gift pack for anyone who might enjoy these films. Quality of acting is high, the production quality excellent and the special effects generally superb. There were a few less than realistic points in Backdraft but fire scenes are notoriously difficult to simulate. The stories themselves are not my normal preference, but so well depicted that each movie draws the viewer along for the duration. From a very personal viewpoint I'd rate the films overall as follows, out of 5 stars. Backdraft **** Apollo 13 ***** A beautifull mind ***** Cinderalla man ***** I never thought I'd rate a boxing movie as 5*, but it is so well executed from the sets through the acting to what appears a very realistic and detailed portrayal of the period that I discovered it to be enthralling in the way it tells a timeless tale. Enjoy or gift, you or the recipient is unlikely to be disappointed. great movies, awesome director SO GOOD...The heroism of people who are just plain joe's.........Ron Howad gets it right every time. Four great movies for less than the usual price of one. Great quality and excellent movies. A great rainy week-end escape! Great """"The Ron Howard Spotlight Collection"""" is an eight-disc box set containing four Howard-directed features, including the Best Picture Oscar winner """"Beautiful Mind,"""" the story of brilliant mathematician John Nash (Russell Crowe). The set also contains a heap of bonus extras, including an introduction by Howard himself, deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, feature commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and documentaries on the real individuals portrayed. """"Backdraft"""" is a fairly routine story about two feuding firefighter brothers (Kurt Russell, William Baldwin) who have to set aside their personal differences in order to survive the infernos set by a maniacal arsonist. Fire is the real star, with spectacularly staged sequences that look incredibly dangerous. Drama-wise, the movie is a familiar reworking of a classic plot and offers few surprises. """"Apollo 13"""" is riveting drama with the all-star cast of Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris. Here we have the true story of a space flight that would have ended in disaster were it not for the coordination of flight and ground crews to bring the astronauts back safely. In the confines of a claustrophobic space capsule, Howard manages to make a tale whose outcome is known, gripping. """"Cinderella Man,"""" a fine movie that did poorly at the box office, takes place in Depression-era America. Down-and-out boxer Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) has a young family but few prospects. Desperate, he accepts an offer to do battle with the reigning world heavyweight champ, proving himself a popular underdog and a champion of the common man. fine director love it !! Great product for a great price. . Heartfelt movies. Makes you want to give to charity.. The few I have watched were great, have not had time to enjoy the remaining movies in the set, but I am sure they are great. Great movies! Nice Collection Of Film That I Mistakenly Purchased Thinking They Were Blu-Ray Version. A BEAUTIFUL MIND and CINDERELLA MAN are a truly touching films directed by Ron Howard. If you are not familiar with the stories I will only say that to give away any details of this movie would be inappropriate. A BEAUTIFUL MIND builds at an interesting pace and is lethargic at times , yet it remains intriguing and emerges into a heartfelt statement about our true selves and the meaning of love, commitment and the essence of mind and being. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give brilliantly realistic performances and make this film work. A lot also has to be said of James Horner's insightful and moving score, which only enhances the viewer's insight and response to the film's statement. This film is beautiful and one of Ron Howard's best. CINDERELLA MAN tackles a different subject matter but once again our hero Russell Crowe has to come to realizations and overcome insurmountable odds. CINDERELLA MAN was oddly overlooked at the time of its release. That was a shame. APOLLO 13 is thoughtful inspiring film. BACKDRAFT is one of Ron Howard's most watchable films. There is as much subtlety as there is in your face pyrotechnics in BACKDRAFT. Each time I watch it I see something new, something I missed. It all comes together. These 4 films are great films. Played this selection to some of my younger siblings and they loved it too! Backdraft and Apollo 13 are great A beautiful Mind is one I don't enjoy and I didn't watch Cinderella Man Love it Okay, you'll never go wrong with Ron Howard directing. The bonus material is an interesting added extra, but the films carry the day. I bought this primarily for """"Apollo 13"""", being one of my favorite films ever. I had seen """"Backdraft"""", which was well done but only worth a watch one time for me. I had never seen """"Cinderella Man"""", and boy, was I ever missing something! What a gem! And I found myself fascinated with """"A Beautiful Mind"""". I sort of wished """"The Paper"""" had been included, but I'll have to save that for another day. Bought this basically for Apollo 13. The other movies were just a bonus, and I haven't watched them yet. Overall the packaging is very nice, though a bit bigger than a normal DVD case so it sticks out a little bit on the shelf, which isn't a bad thing because it makes it easier to pick up. for the set of 4 there are 8 discs in total. Each one is entirely different from the other. but these still stand the test of time individually. Three excellent movies. This is a must have for your dvd collection. Great price with it bundled like this. Can't go wrong."""	Backdraft

IT SHOWS ABOUT ABORTIONS AND A BOY GROWING INTO A MAN! Great movie to watch. Outstanding performances by all the actors. It gives you a peak of orphanages in the early 20th century. A complicated plot, mixing issues of racism, incest/rape, abortion, and infidelity - all wound around life in an orphanage and apple orchard. Homer, a twice-returned orphan, is groomed by Dr. Larch as his replacement, but takes off to see the world. En route, falls in love with a bomber pilot's girl-friend, while expanding his understanding of life by working at the lowest rung on the ladder - apple picker. Well done, though the title theme ('Cider House Rules') was a bit of a stretch. At the end, everything falls into place as the issues sort of resolve themselves. This is a truly wonderful movie and better than I remembered. It is a great period piece and is a feel good movie. The upgrade to blu ray is well worth it since the visuals are spectacular. This has been a favorite film of mine for the past 12 years. It's well done and extremely moving. So happy to have it on blu-ray and thank you Amazon for the killer price tag! I can't help loving this emotionally touching coming-of-age film. And Charlize Theron has to be the most glamorous thing to ever stuff rotted bait into a lobster trap. I'd chop chum with her any day. But I understand the objections of the one-star detractors. This movie does make a whole lot of wrong things seem right, such as: 1) Sniffing ether for recreational kicks 2) Casual abortions concluding in an unceremonious fetus toss into the incinerator 3) Fornicating with your buddy's girlfriend while he's off at war 4) Exemption from military service via fraudulent medical records 5) Practicing medicine without a license, leading to 6) Impersonating a doctor using forged credentials The film finally draws a moral line by condemning Mr Rose's incest with his daughter. So we can be glad for that, at least. **********SPOILER ALERT******* A captivating film about a young boy growing up in a Maine orphanage. A multitude of subplots involving racism, abortion, infidelity, loyalty, and drug addiction keeps you enthralled till the very end of the film. The scenery and locations, from the Maine forests to the coastline were breathtaking. The acting and storyline held up to the location, and was one of the best movies we've seen in quite a while. Tobey Maguire did an excellent job playing the innocent and somewhat naive orphan, dealing with lifes' issues and venturing out on his own to gain valuable expieriences, only to return to the orphanage as a man to take over the day to day operations, much to the joy of the orphans he had left behind. A FILM NOT TO BE MISSED! *** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY REISSUE *** Lasse Hallstrom's 1999 adaptation of John Irving's 1985 book (of the same name) is a rather lovely little film - that's genuinely been upgraded by BLU RAY. It's not note-perfect as a transfer by any means (soft focus here and there, a bit of grain and blocking too) - but when it's good (which is a lot of the time) - it's really gorgeous to look at. You notice the improvements especially when the story gets to the home and lands of Olive Worthington and her son Wally (great casting in Kate Nelligan and Paul Rudd). She's an estate-owning boss and he's a dashing young Airforce Pilot who is waiting for overseas action in the Second World War. Even the indoor scenes in the live-in hut where all the apple pickers live (the 'Cider House' mentioned in the title) are very clear and at times amazingly so. The faces and clothing of the actors are razor-sharp too (superb cast choices in Delroy Lindo, Erykah Badu, Evan Park, Heavy D, and K. Todd Freeman). So too when Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire's character) is out walking with Wally's beautiful and vivacious fianc Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) while Wally's away at war - the shots by the Sea and the nearby lobster fishing port are beautiful to look at. Acting-wise - there is so much to savour here. A huge part of the film's heart has to go to touching performances from children - Erik Per Sullivan as the bronchial Fuzzy, Kieran Culkin as the troubled Buster and Paz De La Huerta as the young teenage girl who fancies Homer way too much for her own good. Throw in Kathy Baker and Jane Alexander as elderly nurses with an abundance of unconditional paternal heart - and it feels good the second it opens. The story then moves as Homer does away from the snowbound hills and rivers of Maine to the sunny fields of working orchards in South Carolina. But the movie belongs to its two principal leads - Michael Caine as Dr. Wilbur Larch and Tobey Maguire as the emotionally stilted orphan boy - Homer Wells (named after a cat and someone whose deep). First up is Caine who is simply sensational. Moving like a force of benevolent kindness amid the cold wooden rooms of """"St. Clouds"""" (a 1930's and 1940's Orphanage he runs) - he is pragmatic and practical to the visiting pregnant women who don't need judgement (dialogue above) but an operation that is illegal. Describing himself as """"...a caretaker to many, father to none..."""" - he mother hen's over a lively cast of young children abandoned in the big house with an almost casual cruelty. Each hurt child of course longs to be genuinely wanted - to be taken away by childless parents who occasionally come to visit and adopt. The scene where one pretty girl appeals to a couple - so they take her - but leave the rest behind - is heartbreaking. Caine imbibes so many of these difficult moments with a huge humanity - he's an actor capable of conveying extraordinary compassion and anger - sometimes one after the other. The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards and won 2 - one for Caine as Best Supporting Actor and the other for Best Adapted Screenplay by John Irving. Tobey Maguire excels too - his performance is full of quiet acceptance at first - but then moves into a longing for a more varied life outside of his mentor's 'doctoring' requirements. Homer's journey to his own 'purpose in the world' is long but convincing. Maguire is very, very good here. As is Charlize Theron - not just a beautiful woman - but a hugely accomplished actress. Watch out too for John Irving the Author in a tiny cameo as a Station Master at the beginning (doing his Hitchcock). The """"Making Of"""" interviews all the principal actors - as well as John Irving on adapting his own book, Stephen King (the Author) on Irving's writing and Lasse Hallstrom the Director on shooting such a huge book. Its default aspect is 1.2:35 so it has bars top and bottom of the screen - but even stretched to full screen - it still looks great. """"The Cider House Rules"""" is a warm film - and one I thoroughly enjoyed re-watching. But more importantly - if you're a fan and have love for this movie's combined cruelties and charms - then you need to see it/own it on BLU RAY. Highly recommended. ASPECT: 1.2:35:1 Ratio SUBTITLES: English for the Hard-Of-Hearing EXTRAS: Making Of """"An American Classic"""" Deleted Scenes Trailer PS: for other recent reissues on BLU RAY - see also: """"Amelie"""", """"Beautiful Girls"""", """"American Graffiti"""", """"Bright Star"""", """"Shakespeare In Love"""", """"Love Actually"""", """"A.I - Artificial Intelligence"""", """"Bubba Ho-Tep"""", """"Gone Baby Gone"""" and """"Michael Clayton"""" This story touches on various important themes - rites of passage, freedom vs. responsibility, etc. - but like certain real life events or lessons, it's one of those things that you experience and then move on. This is not a movie for watching over and over. That would be missing the point. I saw it once, enjoyed it very much, and invite you to do the same. Good story and had a interesting finish. If you've been nauseated, not to mention totally disappointed by 90+% of the new releases on dvd rental shelves, here at last in this older movie is your reward. Virtually every, I mean every actor delivers top notch performances with a plot line that only an author of the stature of John Irving could achieve. Visually exhilarating and always tugging at your heartstrings from many different angles, this piece is flawless. No room for improvement and always entertaining in every way. Do treat yourself to this film. You may never see another of this quality. This film depicts likeable people caught up in circumstances where it seems not only normal but legitimate for them to lie, commit suicide, commit abortions, engage in incest, commit murder, live a lie (the main character finally """"chooses"""" to go back to his old orphanage and pretend he is a doctor using a fake diploma), betray a close friendship, fornicate,...you name it: everything people shouldn't do is done. The workers who work seasonally picking apples at an apple orchard in Maine have some rules tacked to their wall which they scorn. Eventually, the rules are thrown in the fire, and the head apple picker says, """"The rules were written by people who don't live here; we live here...."""" This is a metaphor for the movie. All the rules about morality are inherited from others who don't live here on planet Earth in the good old USA now. Therefore, those rules don't apply. This is the kind of existentialism that traces back to Albert Camus' novel The Stranger where the characters are reacting to circumstances, even the main character who is eventually tried for murder. They are just people caught up in living their lives. Any attempt to judge them by rules or a moral standard is bogus. The thing about this movie if you just look at it uncritically and enjoy the beautiful scenery, the beautiful looking actors and actresses, and the personalities, all of whom seem superficially likeable and attractive, you might not notice that they have broken every rule in the book, every rule of morality or Judeo-Christian morality, whatever you want to call it. Therefore the movie ultimately makes bad seem good, and I don't recommend it at all. Truly a morally degraded and degrading film. With the hope that you will not be mislead as I was, you need to know that this movie is a story about a kindly, old abortionist and his protege. If you can live with that, it's a good film. If your conscience is troubled with the presentation of a pair of abortionists as """"nice guys"""", you will be put off by the film. I destroyed my copy. The Bottom Line: The Cider House Rules is a bit meandering but it's an effective and sometimes moving character piece that highlights a wonderful performance by Michael Caine in an all-around solid piece of filmmaking. Homer Wells (Maguire) was born and raised in a New England orphanage under the care and tutelage of Dr. Wilber Larch (Caine), who came to the orphanage to be a hero. Homer was considered one of the 'unadoptables'. The first couple who took him was disapointed because he didn't cry (orphan babies don't cry). The second couple made Homer cry by abusing him. Homer became Dr. Larch's apprentice, tending the sick children, delivering women of babies they're surrendering, but Homer drew the line at aborting babies. It was against the law. Larch advises Homer when he leaves that he will find harsher conditions out in the world, but will be unable to do as much as the orphanage could. When a young couple Wally and Candy (Rudd and Theron) come to get an abortion, Homer leaves with them. While Wally"""	Cider House Rules The

Christina's driving desire to prove herself in a male dominated world is intensified by her focus on the marketing and business of football  in which all coaches and players are merely properties.Drama , brutality corruption football intense male-nudity original sports ,""this is natural born killers ... only that they are playing football now and instead of the murders you get first class war right on the football-field - and right behind it! this movie rocks - any furhter questions?! RENT / BUY / WHATEVER / JUST WATCH / ! With cliches and all, this film is better than the overated Gladiator, movie that I don{t see how it could win the Oscar. AnNd I say this seriously. I thought that the movie Gladiator had a poor script, and as much as cliches -and maybe even more- than this one. Im not saying that these two movies are similar, but they do relay on the pumped-up macho thing... battles in the field, and on the arena, etc. The reason why Gladiator won an Oscar it was because it was a historical epic, set in the Rman Empire, so that impresses people. But the movie was much poorer, flawed, brainless and less entertaining than this Oliver Stone's OK film. OLIVER STONE by now has treated every theme possible about the AMERICAN institutions. He has sometimes succeeded in doing so(PLATOON,BORN IN THE FOURTH OF JULY,JFK);sometimes he failed miserably(HEAVEN AND EARTH,NIXON).ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a fair movie about that marvelous AMERICAN institution called football. The usual four letter words are present;the overuse of montage is also on display;these are two items you can always find in any STONE movie. Characters often talk all in the same time. Yet ANY GIVEN SUNDAY has entertaining value,and tells a few truths well included in the script(Television killed that sport).CHARLTON HESTON a real AMERICAN legend has one scene;the use of clips of BEN-HUR is out of place. One of the pleasant surprize of this film is the performance of CAMERON DIAZ as the team's owner. As for AL PACINO,he gives his usual foul mouthed speeches,sometimes annoying,sometimes on target. If you don't think about it too much,you can actually swallow this piece of AMERICAN junk without trowing up. Good luck!

This is a familiar film but it`s has energy and some scenes of exciting Football Scenes. Super 35. Grade:B+. Loud, raucous, and at times indecipherable, Any Given Sunday is director Oliver Stone's best movie in years. After all, all of Stone's pictures are loud, raucous and at times indecipherable. Off hand, I can think of three kinds of movies that are supposed to be this way - action movies, war movies and football movies. This incisive look at a pro football team undergoing a make or break period is, in my opinion, the best picture about the game ever made. The movie opens in the middle of a game that is going badly for the Miami Sharks. The team is on a losing streak and really need a win. To make matters worse, star quarterback Jack Rooney [Dennis Quaid] suffers a major back injury. Coach Tony D'Amato [Al Pacino] has no choice but to send in third string quarterback, Willie Beaman [Jamie Foxx], who blows enough plays to cause the team to lose. Up in a posh sky box, owner and general manager Christina Pagniacci [Cameron Diaz] is furious. Christina's deceased father founded the team, and D'Amato has led it to many victorious seasons in his thirty years as coach. This means little to Christina, a ruthless businessperson, whose goal is to sell the franchise. She can't get top dollar for a losing team. There is not an ounce of sentimentality, much less sympathy, in this woman. By the next game, D'Amato has worked his magic on Beaman, who turns out to be a great football player after all. Success soon goes to his head, however, and he becomes an egotistical nightmare for the coach and the team. Rooney is trying to get well enough to return for the playoffs, but in his heart, he knows he's getting too old for the game. Another back injury could land him in a wheelchair permanently. There is much more to Any Given Sunday's story, but it is the movie's drive and the great acting that make it so good. Nobody can play a man in the twilight of his glory better than Al Pacino. Cameron Diaz is so good as the heartless Christina that she's almost scary. Jamie Foxx gives a career making performance as Willie Beaman, while LL Cool J is first-rate as Julian Washington, a star player who's had one concussion too many. The film has been criticized for the fast, jumpy edits involving the action on the field, though I really liked them. The idea is not to sit and watch football plays. The idea is to put the viewer on the field with the players, and Oliver Stone achieved this. These scenes are so intense that I came away feeling a bit bruised myself. There have also been complaints that the movie's producers couldn't get the NFL to cooperate. If the NFL had done so, the result would have been as squeak clean as the war movies the Department of Defense used to approved of. What Stone does is to portray the players as modern day gladiators. He also pulls no punches in dealing with the issues of money, fame and the abuse of power and of privilege. His Miami Sharks may not be representative of pro football on the whole, but the team does have problems and issues which often do occur in real life. I liked """"Any Given Sunday"""" and I am not even a football fan but, once I got pass the football aspect of the movie I really enjoyed it. Jaime Foxx puts on an excellent performance, and I finally got to see him in a different light instead of the comedy roles that he usually does. Oliver Stone is a maniac, his movies are stylistic funhouses which showcase just how far one can push film as a stylistic medium. Any Given Sunday is a fairly mainstream football movie, you have the aging mentor to the arrogant youngster, the coach on his last year and the big game at the end, although it really isn't a big game. Somehow, it doesn't feel formulaic because Stone and his case invest and bring so much energy to the preceedings. The NFL scenes are relentlessly outlandish, most say they are unrealistic; So what, if they were realistic you would be watching a regular football game, why would you want to do that. The cast is uniformly excellent, Al Pacino isn't disappointing as he rarely if ever is. Cameron Diaz is amazing as the team owner who can more than act head on with Pacino. Jamie Foxx is very convincing as an arrogant player who begins to reform as the season winds on. All in all, if you have seen this movie, odds are you knew it was directed by Oliver Stone. What did you expect, Rudy. It is stylistic overkill, but it fits the material so it's successful, the only time style overcomes a story is when the story doesn't warrant the style. A fact lost on most """"pure"""" pseudo film-buffs. I recommend watching it and experiencing the Oliver Stone view of football, it's very different from everything else. You know, I like Al Pacino, I really do, but I am sick of him playing almost the same role over and over. It does not matter if he is a Mafia man, a football coach or a 60 Minutes producer... I think in each of the films (Donnie Brasco, Any Given Sunday, and The Insider, respectively), he has been someone's protector, insisting almost verbatim, """"I fought for you..."""" In Donnie Brasco he takes Donnie (Johnny Depp) under his wing and mentors him and feels about him as though he were a son. In the Insider, he is a passionate 60 Minutes producer who convinces Jeffrey Wigand to be a whistlerblower on tobacco companies. When 60 Minutes will not air the piece, Pacino is livid and when confronted by Russell Crowe (as Wigand) he yells, """"I fought for you..."""" In this film, Any Given Sunday, he feels paternal about his aging quarterback, Dennis Quaid, and tells him how he will fight for him and how he feels about him like a son. How many times do we need to see the same performance? I know, I might be stomping on hallowed ground. Pacino has paid his dues and I should not criticise, but has this thought occurred to anyone? That he has been playing and replaying the same roles? Of course, he is a prolific actor and there are many roles he has played which have no resemblance to these, but I am just picking out a pattern. Cannot be ignored. And he is superb in all these performances, so I am not complaining. I liked this film. It was an interesting look at football and its place in American society. I think, personally, that it is taken far too seriously, and I don't care about it. But to see that it warrants this kind of attention is a fascinating thought. It is interesting to see Pacino as a coach who appears to be in the twilight of his coaching career. He is being driven out by his traditional views, by the rich, young and aggressive woman who is in charge of the team (Cameron Diaz in a spectacularly bitchy role). Ageism is at work. She wants to push Pacino out to make room for Aaron Eckhart as coach. This has an interesting directorial style, probably because it was directed by Oliver Stone... you can always count on him for something at least a little out of the ordinary. A good, solid film, but by far not the best film Pacino has done nor is it the best film about football. The thesis, football as a symbol of the decline of a bygone age of honor and teamwork, is compelling enough to carry a film. Any Given Sunday kicks off with throbbing action and razor-sharp editing to achieve this goal. But why make a point once when you can make it forty seven times? It only takes three hours, plus you can toss in liberal drones of waffling yet verbose dialogue. Why, we may even shoot the plays from so up, close and personal that the audience cannot for the life of it figure out the dozen time warps between scoreboards. Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J do the occasional serious turn, Dennis Quaid grimaces like only he can (in natural agony, an emotion the audience effortlessly echoes) and Cameron Diaz bursts a windpipe to be the shrieking pseudo-toughguy. Pacino follows a similar routine to deliver the famous speech towards the tail-end, by when most of us are comfortably asleep. Perhaps a tolerable watch for diehard fans of the game, but the only football that gets bobbed about in this blur of color is the audience. Out of All the Brilliant Actors that pop up here and there in """"Any Given Sunday"""", The Best Performance is given by Jamie Foxx, whose Star turn as Willie Beamen is an Absolute Revelation. He Holds his own in"""	Any Given Sunday

Gotham's simplistic but dark, tall, and gothic (pun VERY MUCH intended) style, the way that most of the scenes in """"the present"""" were never during the day, the ingenious use of flashbacks, all came together to make a visually stunning movie. And this was a cartoon that didn't pull its punches. It was one of the only """"kid-oriented"""" animated films to recieve a PG rating back in the 90's. The voice cast was spectacular. The characters of Comissioner Gordan, Detective Bullock, Alfred; all are wonderfully cast (I would argue that this movie has the best Alfred of any Batman film EVER). And of course, the casting of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (Batman and The Joker respectively) in a reprise of their roles on the show couldn't have happened any other way, simply because they embody these characters so well, and put far more heart into their performances than you get from many live-action parts (read: the last two live-action Batmans). The story is both simple and complicated at the same time. Sure, some kids won't get all of it, but the thing is rated PG for a reason. A killer has shown up in Gotham, a murderer who is offing mob bosses with brutal efficiancy. The D.A. blames Batman, and starts a city-wide manhunt. On the Bruce Wayne side of things, an old flame has returned to Gotham (voiced by Dana Delany, the same dame who did Lois Lane in the Superman animated series; funny ol' world, in' it?), who is, in a roundabout way, the reason Batman was able to exist. Bruce is torn between his love, and the responsibilities of, and new dangers to, his secret identity. Batman is turned into a fugitive by the police, even as he tries to unmask the mysterious """"Phantasm"""" murderer, and tries to keep his head together as Bruce Wayne all the while. There are a LOT of flashbacks, all of which give us a lot of insight to Bruce Wayne, Batman, and even a little about the Joker. Of course Joker gets involved eventually, (Mark Hamill RULES), and we get one of the greatest battles between the two arch-nemeses ever put to screen. Honestly, it makes the battle on the clock tower in the 1989 """"BATMAN"""" seem downright tame, and that's no small feat. Another great part of the movie is the love story. It is iconic of the comics, and easily the best love story in an american-made animated film. Also, it doesn't feel the need (like so many other animated films do) for everything to have a perfectly happy ending. It's like things turn out in life, and how things always seemed to end up in the comic book. Ironic how this animated Batman can feel more real than the live-action ones at times. Not to put down Tim Burton's movies in any way (I absolutely loved Batman, and Batman Returns was, aside from the butchering of Penguin's character, a more than worthy sequel), this is the REAL Batman movie. It shows parts of his origin, gives a glimpse of his phsyche, and explores the darker sides of Batman's quest for retribution, what he could have become. An astounding movie, though really not for kids under six. Make no mistake, this film deserves a place of honor right next to its (original) live-action counterpart. Again, that is no small feat. This is a terrific movie that is so much better than any of the live action movies! It has a brillant plot,terrific voice overs(especially Kevin Conroy as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Mark Hamill as the Joker),and one terrific ending. If you are a fan of Batman,then would recommend this movie! See this! Although the animation and voice talent was tremendous (even had Abe Vigoda - love that gravelly voice) the story line was so weak and the resolution was not thought through. It was like the producers said """"Ooh! Let's have a hot sexual theme because we are now in a theater and can avoid the censors!"""" Any Batman fan knows he forsook love because of his dedication to his second persona (Batman). In Mask, Batman appears weak and controlled by his libido. I was uncomfortable with the scene implying [physical interaction] had taken place between Bruce and Andrea. The blatant sexual story didn't fit with Batman as how we have come to know him. Nor did it fit with the masterful animated series, which used subtleties so powerfully. In the Ras-Al-Ghul episodes, his romance with Talia is cinematic, his affection for and implied dalliance (Cat Scratch Fever) with Catwoman fit with the series and Batman's character. Even his chick from the past, Zatana, is acceptable. This is because at all times, Batman remains in control of his emotions. In Phantasm, he acts like a pimply fourteen year old, even spying on Andrea in plain sight with binoculars! The movie's resolution was extremely sloppy. The Phantasm was a compelling character, but the strength and movement the Phantasm displayed was never explained, like a Scooby Doo episode, when the monster's head is pulled off and reveals weak """"Uncle Albert."""" Also, the Joker and Harley are depressing rather than scary/humorous as in the series. I love Batman: the Animated Series. I went to a lot of trouble to tape every episode. I even put the tapes in a safe deposit box at one point, when I lived in an apt. with incidents of crime. When I saw the poster for this film, I was dizzy with delight. When I came out of the theater I felt sick to my stomach and almost cried. I highly recommend the movie Batman and Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero, as well as the Batman Beyond series and movies. They are truer to the Batman characters to say the least. This is one of the best Batman animated features I have ever seen. The writing was good and Mark Hamill doing the voice of the Joker?G-O-O-D.The soundtrack gets high marks and the actors picked to voice the characters was good. With plans to make a new series of Batman feature films in the works,I would like for Warner Brothers studios to please keep Tim Burton as the executive producer and most important,Michael Keaton as Batman because he is the right actor for the role. I've heard a few things about this movie, and when I watched it, I was very pleased. The quality is good. The story for it is well written. It's about Batman trying to clear his name when he's accused of killing mob bosses, but it's also a tragic love story. Both parts of story actually tie in really well. And, The Joker is deliciously evil as always. I am a big fan of the graphic novel Batman: The Dark night retuns. I saw this at a DVD store and said why not? I did not think much about it. The when I saw it I loved it. If felt like I was waching a batman graphic novel on screen. This is a good DVD and I think it should be in everyone's DVD collection If I had to pick which animated movie deserves high praise, this would be one of them. The way this movie is done was actually so wel thought out, it puts most live movies to shame. First off, this movie is more about Bruce Wayne than Batman himself and shows his past with his true love. The setup is pretty much someone is going around killing off the mob bosses and the police believe its Batman. A connection is found when his once true love and her father returned who ran away from these mob bosses many years ago. Is it one of them doing it or someone else? Great movie that shows the origin of batman, and no, not the parent killing part but the true beginning with his first mission before he chose the costume. Also shows the early days of the joker and one of Bruces loves (he had many, though whats funny is that on an episode of Batman Beyond, they showed every one of Bruces past loves except for this one which was odd). Anyways a great animated movie to get and lets just say, everything about it is perfect. This film is probably one of the most underated films ever made. The movie is based off the popular animated T.V. series on Fox, and it has the Dark Knight chasing a new adversary called the Phantasm while fighting his arch nemesis Joker too. Sparks will fly in this action packed movie for the entire family to enjoy. The story still suffers from being predictable though, but it offers some unique plot twists to keep you interested. Overall, I highly recommend this one. Back when the film was released, my dad gave me a copy of it on VHS and I always loved it but after awhile as usual with things, you lose track of it and forgot where it was. Out of town one year, bam, there it is on the shelf so I nabbed it. Like a lot of reviewers have said, it combines the dark film noir style with that over-the-topness of the films. One thing I never really got with the films is Bruce Wayne's complexity. Although on a show that has a different superhero, to paraphrase Smallville's Chloe Sullivan, Bruce Wayne has more issues than Rolling Stone. He made a vow that he would protect the innocent. Basically the story is that mob bosses are being killed off by a grim reaperesque villain named the Phantasm(although oddly, that name's never mentioned). However, due to the image of the Phantasm's costume and blink and you'll miss it images, Batman instead gets blamed. None of which is helped by a commissioner who has it in for him, probably his one true love returning, and his battle with an old nemesis. One thing has got to be said first off: this is one amazing score. The woman responsible did an astounding job and the opening theme is great. The voices are great too. Kevin Conroy does 2 voices(although slightly similar) voices for Batman and Bruce, so that way people close to him wouldn't figure out his voice if they met Batman. And who knew that Mark """"I'll always been known as Luke Skywalker"""" Hamill would give a crazier performance as the Joker than Jack Nicholson? One thing that's nice about the film is that it is quite dark. There's quite a few flashbacks and they're not quick either. There's a certain amount of complexity to the plot for the kiddies but adults will understand it. It's nice to see a different version of how Bruce Wayne started becoming Batman, and his inspiration for the Batmobile's a nice touch. Like most people that are fans of this, we're waiting for a DVD release. If they're has been one, then an SE one cause I've never heard of it. Rumors are that they'll release it along with the Tim Burton Batman films to coincide with the release of Batman Begins in June which should be interesting. However, for now, deal with a film that Joel Schumacher wish he directed. I honestly believe that this is the best animated movie spun off from a television show and based on a comic book character. The story, animation, voice acting, dialogue, music, etc deliver an overall great execution. It's unfortunate that I missed this when it was in theaters because I was simply too young at the time. When I got older and later became a fan of Batman: The Animated Series, I checked this out on VHS and from there didn't see it again until I got it on DVD. Like I've already said, this really is a great movie, as for the DVD itself, it's a good transfer, but lacks bonus materials except the trailer. Don't let the PG"""	Batman Mask of the Phantasm

They have said you need to calibrate your set, or that you shouldn't watch the disc on vivid and sharp mode. But lowering these settings is not enough to get rid of all the digital noise on this disc, and it's the only blu-ray I've ever come across that looks this bad. I encourage you to rent the disc before you buy it, so you can see for yourself. I hate giving one star to a movie this good. But the Blu-ray is not even worthy of that one star. There is a layer of rich splendor created in the cinematography of this film in its deftly applied attention to detail. A film critic's essay included with the Criterion Blu Ray edition notes that Merchant/Ivory productions had decades of experience in making the sets look authentic and lived in, and while having appreciated it to some degree in previous viewings on VHS, DVD, and even streaming - these true details brought forth in such clarity in the Blu Ray version explode in a violence that took my breath away. Set in London's early 20th century, the film dresses its people and furnishings in subdued hues of browns, greys, beige, olive green and powdered blues - the shocking contrasts of colorific beauty are highlighted and segment the film when it switches to Howards End in its springtime glory, or Leonard Bast's nature walk out of London, or his wife Jackie's tacky fuchsia wardrobe. There is a level of intent from the filmmaker in these transitions and contrasts that becomes evident and meaningful to the story craft and is only fully appreciable in the Blu Ray. I've seen this film dozens of times and never before had I noticed how many beautiful and stunning scarfs and shawls Margret dons throughout the film. Let alone the glorious Wedgewood, China, and amazing works of art that inhabit all the sets. However, when I first started the Blu Ray I was horrifed and thought it was an exceptionally poor transfer. It was as grainy as a beach, with white dots littering the screen. I was able to resolve this by changing my TV's settings to appreciate the picture. My TV comes with a range of preset brights/huges/and balance controls - which of course you can use to set your own as well. I usually have mine set to """"vibrant."""" However, this was too much for the delicate film work here and had the film screaming bits of grain and white flashes at me - a switch to my TV's """"cinematic"""" preset made the Blu Ray brilliantly rendered. If you find the Blu Ray lacking, play with your picture settings. If you're like me, you have your colors and brightness up rather high and this film requires darker settings - I guess its like the equalizer settings on your stereo, you wouldn't use the same settings for rock-n-roll and classical. I'm not a techie so I don't know how correct my assessment is, but I do now that once I made the adjustments, the film was still in absolute high definition, and far more stunning and visually engaging than the DVD. Faithful to the book there is nary a detail left out, a few minor details are juxtaposed here or there for a tighter film fit - In my judgment this is the most faithful and positively perfect rendering of a classic book to film ever attempted. The script is expertly crafted, and it is cast under the divine intervention of kismet. Thompson and Hopkins have undeniable chemistry. The film is quite simply a masterpiece and it is a rare example of film's capacity to harmonize with other art forms. The written word is brought to life, the soundtrack is exquisite, and the locations are teeming with exuberance and life. Yet this film is most certainly not for everyone, as evidenced by the many """"It's boring"""" reviews here. There is no instant fix, explosions or romantic endings. Like any work of literary fiction, plot is not the catalyst here - the human experience is exposed through patient character development letting you experience E.M. Forster's most poignant commandment: """"Only connect."""" There is something terribly wrong with this transfer. Every time there is a dark scene, I see lots of speckles and grains in the picture. And I am not just being picky. I have never seen anything this bad in any blu-ray (or DVD) release. I am shipping my copy back to Criterion for an explanation and hopefully a refund. Few films come together so perfectly as Howard's End. There is a precision to this film, all it's elements working perfectly together, that is a marvel to watch. Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins are sublime - a pure joy to watch. The adaptation of Forester's novel is fluid and respectful of the many aspects of the book - a difficult, sprawling story. It creates an urgent narrative for the cinema while maintaining Forester's lush, romantic, and easy-going tone. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. It's many layers keep me watching over and over. It made an Emma Thompson fan out of me. No other actress could embody Margaret as Thompson did. She brings radiance and humor to a difficult and central character to portray - balancing everything just so. She makes it look easy. This movie is in my top ten films of all times. This is one of those films that is perfect right along with To Kill A Mockingbird. Buy it, rent it, enjoy it.... The film is wonderful and the Blu-ray transfer is fantastic. It's a clean image with oodles of detail and beautiful, natural colors. The only thing I didn't like so much is that the musical score is quite bright at times, which is disappointing being that I love the score. I don't know if that is due to the way it was originally mixed or if that is Criterion's fault. The audio mix in general is decent considering it's a low budget period drama. This is certainly the best presentation of Howard's End that I've ever experienced. I have loved this movie since I was a teenager. As far as Edwardian-set period films go, this is definitely one of the all time best. That's why it breaks my heart that after months of anticipating owning this film in high definition, the final product that I received is of extremely poor quality to say the least. Unfortunately, it appears that there is a major issue with either the way this disc is being pressed over at Criterion or the way the HD master is being transferred onto the Blu-ray. The picture on my copy is FILLED with digital noise and snow. It's not just a mild amount that might have proved mildly distracting, but a thick layer of white grain that looks as if I'm peering through a blizzard. I logged on to amazon earlier today to see if anyone else was having this same issue and sure enough, others are reporting the same problem on varying levels. The issue is definitely not with my player. I have a magnificent Oppo BDP-83 which always delivers the finest High Definition picture possible on my new Samsung LCD. Should I return my defective disc in hopes of receiving a corrected copy or just inquire about receiving a full refund? I'm really not sure, but I am certainly sad that I am being deprived of enjoying one of my favorite films due to a production error from the otherwise phenomenal Criterion collection. """"Howard's End"""" was one of the strangest movie-watching experiences of my life. I experienced the entire film as one long introduction. """"Okay, this is the scene where they show us what pretty clothes people wore in Edwardian England. This is the scene that displays the cunning antique cars and charming trains they rode in. This scene demonstrates the arch and artificial conversational norms of the period. This is the scene that establishes the lushness and loveliness of the English countryside in high summer."""" Right up until the closing credits, I was waiting for the scene that would involve me in a plot, and make me care about characters. The acting is so unrelentingly cold, arch, and artificial I have to believe that director James Ivory wanted viewers to see only Vanessa Redgrave, Emma Thompson, and Anthony Hopkins, never the characters they allegedly play. These actors may as well be holding scripts in front of their faces. Never for one moment is political activist and Amazon Redgrave believable as a humble little wifey who does not want the right to vote. Anthony Hopkins is Anthony Hopkins, Hannibal Lector in a high collar. Emma Thompson pops out her eyes and strenuously squeezes out some tears, and you think, """"Gosh, she's working so darn hard for that Oscar."""" """"Howard's End"""" isn't two and a half hours of nothingness, though. It is a crystalline demonstration of the contempt that self-congratulatory privileged people feel for the working poor. Mind: I'm not saying that the film critiques snobbery. I'm saying that """"Howard's End"""" is a perfect example of snobbery among the holier-than-thou elite, from Edwardian England's self-righteous upper crust to Barack Obama's limousine liberal supporters. The Schlegels and Wilcoxes are two British families who have lots and lots of cash. The Basts are poor. The rich families are handsome, well groomed, self-disciplined, ever so compassionate and circumspect. The poor are beyond any standard of decency or human appeal. Leonard Bast, the poor man, played by Samuel West, is a creeping creature, half maggot, half weasel, and all idiot. He lives his life stupidly and ends disastrously. His wife, Jacky Bast, is a slovenly, slatternly, obese slut. She is shown, most frequently, in a tight, filthy corset that thrusts her assets into the viewer's face, and dirty robe. She does not brush her hair. She eats like an animal, gets drunk, and embarrasses nice people in public. She is never shown working; most frequently she is lounging on a filthy bed. Leonard Bast could have been shown, as all the rich characters are shown, as having even a rudimentary brain, or dignity, or self-determination. Instead he appears to be constructed of mucus; he is merely a spineless, soulless toy in the hands of the rich characters, whom he discomfits just by existing. The filmmakers could have shown rich and privileged people for what they really are. There could have been scenes of Henry Wilcox, a forty-year-old rich man, inheritor of massive wealth, taking advantage of Jacky when she was a sixteen-year-old orphan attempting to make ends meet by selling her body to this exploiter. We never see that. What we do see is Jacky in control, Jacky crashing Henry's daughter's wedding, Jacky embarrassing Henry, a man the film invites us to admire, feel compassion for, respect and love. There could have been scenes of the Schlegels and Wilcoxes eating sumptuous meals while Leonard and Jacky went days without tasting food. There could have been scenes of how humble clerks like Leonard, desperate for any employment, supplied the labor that the Schlegels and Wilcoxes rode to their own wealth. We don't get those scenes. What we get are scenes of the rich being sensitive and compassionate and beautiful and artistic and refined and admirable, and the poor being disgusting and idiotic and repellent and unpleasant. If """"Howard's End"""" had peddled hatred and contempt for a race of people - blacks, say - rather than a class of people - the working poor - its contempt and bigotry would be condemned and the film would be a museum piece. Instead """"Howard's End"""" peddles the privileged's contemptuous view of the poor, and it is embraced as a classic. Because, no less than in the Edwardian Era, in the """"Bitter"""" Obama Era, hatred of the working poor is entirely A-OK. I recently watched two Nazi propaganda films, """"Jud"""	Howards End

I defy you to find someone who wields hand cannons while chewing a toothpick and looking this cool. See, you can't. HARD BOILED is just great. One of John Woo's absolute best action films. What a shame that the DVD for this is so pitiful. It literally looks like it was duped from a VHS rental tape! On my HD 60"""" TV the picture only fills about 3/4 of the center of the screen. Lame! The source copy is full of specks, dirt and washed out portions. Granted, this DVD is from 1998, but come on! It comes from Criterion, who are far above this public domain level of crappiness. There are a few extras that are nice, but my main reason for buying this was the movie itself, and it left me really wanting and quite disappointed. I coughed up good money for this because I really missed the movie and thought it would be a no-brainer to buy a DVD from The Criterion Collection. Whoops! Shame on me. Should have done some more research. Also, the year of this DVD's original release should have clued me to investigate further. *SIGH* Someone needs to get off their ass and do justice to this Hong Kong action classic and issue a proper re-master of this film in high-def on Bluray. HARD BOILED deserves far, far better treatment than this. If you simply must have the movie, it's a marginally recommended buy. However, if you insist on top quality product for your collection then steer clear of this particular version. 5 stars for the film itself, but subtract 3 for the abysmal treatment it gets with this Criterion(!) release. I first seen this movie on cable 20 years ago , an must say it had a impact on Me . First it brings Chow Yun Fat and John Woo to the world and to action movies . I must say the stunt men in China get away with more dangerous stunts , as for the motorcycle shoot-out , You see a guy's cycle blow up with Him still on it ! John Woo also brought the two-gun gunfight to America . The end shoot -out in the hospital is awesome , even when the Bad guys gun man who got thru most of the movie with only losing a eye at the hospital shows honor an is gunned down by His own Boss . If anyone who plays PS3 try' Stranglehold """", this game is featured after this movie with Chow Yun Fat playing the character in this movie. The only thing I can say about this regular DVD is it's sub-titled , not English Dubbed . I also see that Amazon uses all reviews into all of HARD BOILED DVD formats . This is still a must -see for any hard-core action Fan , the stunts alone is worth the price . Check it out ! I just finished watching the Honk Kong film Hard Boiled for the second time. As an action movie lover, I must admit that this film contains everything I adore about the genre and more. It's a very westernized film, and essentially boils down into a 'loose-cannon cop' movie with a variety of cliches that make American action movies so damn fun. One of the very first scenes contains one of my favorite cliches in which the chief chews out our hero for prematurely ending a case that the force has been working on for months. This cliche can also be found in the films 'Running Scared' and 'Point Break', among others. I find such cliches funny, so they don't bother me much. The action in the film is superb. Explosions everywhere, blood flying all around, innumerable faceless bad guys to kill... what else could one want from an action movie? I tell ya, these guys from Hong Kong sure knew how to deliver the goods. The plot is pretty interesting as well. I won't spoil it for anyone, but be sure to expect some exciting twists and turns along the way. Overall, this is a very enjoyable film. Nothing can prepare for this lesson in film making. """" Action at it's best""""!!! the story is all there but it's the craftsmanship of the action sequences that leave you speechless. Johns Woo's finest moment in cinema. lots of action good movie One of my personal favorites of all time action movie wise, for many years I have been trying to find a new copy of this movie because all I could find was used copies. I like all my stuff new for all my collections movies, books, music. Hard Boiled contains everything I desire in an action movie great story line, intense shoot them up scenes, some comical one liners here there within the movie, and some killer special bonus material with the actors and director. So if your a true fan of John Woo movies and Chow Yun-Fat then this is a the movie for you to add to your movie collection and never get sick of watching it, I watched it a long time ago on TV and watched it last night bringing back great memories, but sometime down the road I even watch it again just for hell of it. So in closing to this day a killer action movie, with great action scenes, and some great bonus material for the action fans out there. I know it's an 90's movie, but..... The acting was really not good. The subtitles did not match what was actually being said. I'm Chinese, so I know. At the first shoot out, did anyone noticed that Chow Yun Fat's character never ran out of bullets, and from two semi automatics, that he picked up off the floor from the gun dealers. That whole sing along with the secret codes, also was a stupid scene and the singing by all three actors, sucked. Let's put it this way, none of them could carry a tune. Think of scratching your nails across the chalk board. That's how irritable it was. Stuffing cotton balls into the Babies ears? Really, that made a difference? John Woo's bit part of playing the Jazz Club Owner and confidant, was bad too. I know he's the director, but he should've just performed that role. And the name used in the English Subtitles, was Mr. Woo. Could they not afford a character name for him? Or did he not respond when they tried calling him another name? Again, I know it's an 90's movie, but think of all the really well made films, like Jaws, ET, Casablanca, A Bridge Too Far, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, Pretty Woman, Year of the Dragon.......all range from the 40's through 90's. Harboiled had the look and feel of the 80's, but it was released in 1992. Which is a shocker, considering quality of the film, and the period, which actually made it look like the 80's. Anyway, I feel like I've paid too much for a movie that really was not John Woo's best, perhaps, maybe, just maybe, it was his best back then. But it's pale in comparison to even Hard Target, which was made in 1993, with Jean Claude van Damme. I guess if you were a teenager growing up in the 90's and watching this movie, maybe it was """"wow"""", but I can't see where there were any """"Wow"""" moments, except when the movie was over. I guess I bought this one thinking it was another gangster flick that Chow-Yun Fat was in. Kind of corny. good movie thank you This Movie is perfect for action fans, John Woo fans, and fans of foreign films. I'm saying if you are a movie fan in general I would check this out. excellent Good Buy Yes, I do mean, YES, the stuntwork and the gunplay in HARD BOILED is freakin' awesome but the final result became (to me, obviously) ok enough already this shoulda' been over 15 minutes ago. I was laughing at the preposterously ridiculous conclusion because I realized the John Woo direction would not stoop to killing one """"character"""" while displaying this is just a movie, don't take this too seriously (not a bad thing) when our hero cop (Chow Yun-Fat) has officially turned into a gun-wielding, people saving, comic book super hero. Dare I say I like my action movies and shootouts with at least a hint more plausibility (like, even, Die Hard had/has) with a barrage of bullets a little less """"selective"""" in NOT finding their mark because our hero can't get killed. Anyways, did I mention the freakin' stunts and shootouts were freakin' awesome?! What a body count! What mayhem! Whew! I didn't even let the endless display of hurtling bodies on sometimes obvious wires spinning and twisting through the air after another explosion deter my entertainment. It was just too cool not too appreciate. I gotta' mention after seeing Chow Yun-Fat again (saw The Replacement Killers first) that it is easy to see why this guy became an international star. Also, the second-lead action star was portrayed very well and very cool by the slighter of frame but very convincing as smooth, tough guy Tony Leung. HARD BOILED had an effective plot twist or two and Director John Woo has a great eye for film making on display with the opening sequence of neon lit Hong Kong shone like classic noir as credits roll and our cop hero to be (with his cop partner on drums) playing some nice jazz saxophone. Love that sh**. Hong Kong looks awesome. The Tea House (with those birds 'visiting') is a place you'd love to visit that you'd hate to see shot-up ... And you can guess how that goes... HARD BOILED boils down (sorry) to being an entertaining ride, but sometimes less is more. One less outrageous shootout of explosions would have rated HARD BOILED better than 4 stars. As it is the xtras are worth a peek with a couple actors (not Yun-Fat or Leung, though), Producer and Director giving interviews (if you can understand John Woo he's kind of amusing). I liked the location filming guide segment that pointed out the Avian Flu closed the Tea House not long after completion of HARD BOILED. No more birds permitted in Tea Houses anywhere. Oh, and I probably never would have realized (without xtras) John Woo plays the bartender in HARD BOILED. Another Chow Yun-Fat movie is in the foreseeable future as is a second look at Woo's Face-Off (with Travolta and Cage). a lot of action good movie though Excellent Movie Classic John Woo !!! This movie a blueprint for all action movies that came after this ... checkout other John Woo movies I've been waiting to see this movie since forever, but finally got off my A** and bought it, and watched it.......It was ok.............j.k. I liked it a lot, none stop action, gun play, gun play, and more gun play. Good cops (depending on who you ask), bad guys, and Undercover cops all going at it. Great early 90's Asian action flick, Chow Yun-Fat is one of the BEST ! Great movie! A classic, bought it as a gift. Hard not to like the movie. Classic movie Finally have one of the the greatest action films all time on blu ray. Every action movie collector should own this. I brought this movie for a friend for christmas andhe like it alot. One of the best movie he wanted and im glad to get it for my friend. A++! I like John woo's Hong Kong films. I have all of his movies include Hollywood movies. This was the last one I bought. Honestly I didn't liked it. Chew Yun Fat was not charm enough to be loved in this film. John woo's slow motion shot didn't really worked. It looked like some cheap movies. I hoped there were more subtitles like Korean. The image and sound"""	Hard Boiled Lashou shentan

The exposure of PG&E's attempts to buy off the innocent victims who were dying of all kinds of various chronic lethal diseases provides a compelling view of the dark side of human nature. This slice of California history serves as a universal eternal morality tale. The story of Erin, compassionate leader of the victims, is truly inspirational and empowering for anyone cowed by corporations, the system, or any of life's challenging situations. And although this movie is instructive for potential activists, be careful when showing to students. I cringed at the F*** bombs, Erin's cleavage and a few almost sex scenes. Students will not be bored. Please note: the audio does not quite turn up to high volume. Great movie! Nicely told with great acting! I love the fact that Ms. Brockovich made this case happen! She was the underdog here when no one wanted to employ her because she didn't have the right look or the job experience. But Brockovich made things work to her advantage. The same can be said of the case in this movie which Brockovich helped her employers research and win! I just can't find the Oscar material here. Keep in mind Steven Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors (""""The Limey"""" is destined to be a classic, I believe) and yes, the film is well shot and edited, but I find the subject matter... well, boring and predictable. I'm told by female friends that Erin is a """"hero"""" to them. Hm? Single mom dresses and talks like a prostitute, has an uncontrollable temper, and takes everything personally, and wonders why people won't give her a break. Ok.... Single mom can't pay the phone bills but seems to have an endless supply of cash for spiked-heeled shoes. Am I leaving anything out? Oh, right: Once the class action suit is in place, the participants are more comfortable with her than the trained lawyers. Very nice, people skills are important in the legal profession. So is knowledge of the law! This is a blueprint for a heroine? great drama film drags a little bit but overall a good movie to watch if you are in a serious mood Strong, emotional, at times pathetic, this film will let you enjoy a real case in its Hollywood rendering. The theme is not new, especially in the US where these disputes about the pollution created by industrial businesses end up all the time in front of a judge. The active woman who is going to fight for that case has three kids, has been married twice and she got divorced twice too. She is fighting for her independence and a motivation in her life in general and professional life in particular. The case is simple: an industrial factory pollutes the soil of a whole residential zone, knows it and hides it to the residents and even lies to them. That Erin Brokovich is doing the only work that can win a case like that: she canvasses all the people who have a reason to claim some damage. She gets them all to sign the document to go in front of a judge. In spite of not liking the procedure chosen by the new experienced associate of the firm she goes along with it and even finds a direct witness of the misbehavior of the business and of its concealing methods. That witness has even stolen some documents that he was supposed to destroy. That will bring an unexpectedly high result and Erin will get a nice check in the end. But Julia Roberts is excellent because she embodies a pugnacious lady that is both stubborn and effective, charming at times and uncompromising when necessary. She manages to win the heart of her son over, though he is young, the understanding and support of her third boyfriend who is going to be the third husband one day, and of course the case more than anything else. There is no real suspense in the film but the impersonation of Erin Brokovich by Julia Roberts is the real charm of the story. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Crteil, CEGID I told my father some of the story behind the movie and he wanted to see it after that. So Amazon of course was my source! I knew I'd find the DVD there. Sure enough I did and had it shipped to my dad. Can't wait until he watches it. Great stroy! This movie turned out to be uncompatible with my equipment. Tried passing it on to my friend who tends to own more variety but no luck for her either, gave it to charity and re-purchased another. Not the fault of seller. It was and excellent movie and the interviews with the real Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry made the movie even better. Product is perfect! Excellent acting by all. Excellent story. I was so happy to recieve this DVD. I love Julia Roberts and have never been disappointed in any movies she has made great This was a solid movie. It is sad that there are single mothers who are trying to balance work with caring for their children. At least Erin had some help from the neighbor. Unfortunately her job didn't allow her to be with her children for very much over about a year's time. It is good that there are people who try to prevent companies from poisoning our water, but there is speculation that the chemicals put into the water by Pacific Gas & Electric were not harmful enough to cause cancers and other health problems. PG&E, Pacific Gas And Electric company, unintentionally polluted ground water for the town of Hinkley, CA, but tried to cover it up rather than admitting they had caused a major health problem to the residents. This cover up went on for a long time, until a barely-employable spitfire named Erin Brockovich, working for the lawyer Ed Masry, uncovers a strange file of real estate documents which include medical records. Curious as to why a real estate file would contain medical documents, she begins to research the case. What follows is the true story of a woman named Erin Brockovich, who together with Ed Masry uncovered a major cover up of a health hazard resulting in one of the largest settlements in history. This film is extremely well done, dividing its time between Erin the worker, Erin the single-mom trying her best to raise her three kids, and Erin the human being. The movie skates over the fact that the real Erin got sick along with the rest of the town (although you can see some cut scenes of her illness in the """"deleted scenes"""" feature). The movie is definitely a dramatized reproduction of the true story, though it still manages to hold very close to the truth. A&E has done a special on the Erin Brockovich case which proves the movie stays true to form. Julia Roberts as Erin and Albert Finney as Ed Masry both give excellent performances. The movie isn't necessarily fast-paced but the dialogue is intriguing, intense at times, and funny at times, keeping the entertainment level high. The acting and dialogue alone are enough to carry this film. If you're a fan of the little guy taking on the giant, or a fan of Julia Roberts, either way you won't be disappointed. Like Grisham's fictional 'The Rainmaker', you'll feel satisfied that sometimes the little guy can win ... in real life. I recommend a 'buy'. Enjoy! Excellent!!! Finney and Robets are both at their best in the true story. I just read that they again obtained a huge settlement in Cal. from the same company that made the first one look like nickles and dimes. Good for them!!! Uhm, nothing special. I just like the movie and bought it because it's never on TV anymore. Or at least I don't see it. this movie is about a rel life average mom who kicks some serious butt fighting for the safety of the residents of hinkley, california. like it says on the cover artwork, erin brockovich brought a small town to its feet and a huge company to its knees...not knees in my eyes. in my eyes she made them fall and land on their butts! erin brockovich is both a role model and inspiration to me! hey, world! women kick butt, too! especially mothers! ms. brockovich, if you are or ever do read this happy mother's day! I used to own this dvd and must have watched it a dozen times. The other night I rented it and it's a classic. Julia Roberts is so good in this, the script is fantastic, and Albert Finney, of course, is brilliant. True story, very moving, and as pertinent today -- more so -- than ever. Really, I love this movie. So inspiring. i love this movie i look foreword of buying more dvds and i love my dvds so thanks again if you got any more dvds like this let me now this movie is a wonderful movie, and shows the corruption of todays society in a way that no other movie really does, Julia Roberts does a wonderful job in this movie I enjoyed Julia Robert's portrayal of Erin Brockovich. She did an awesome job. More than that this is a story about finding one's true purpose in life and making a difference in other's lives. To this day, Erin Brockovich continues to champion causes that others do not chose to touch upon! Well done movie and highly recommended. I love this movie because it is a sotry of someone who worked against tremendous odds and made a success of herself by discovering the gifts she had and never realized. She might never have known the meaning of chutzpah, but she certainly knew how to use it. In the process she winds up revealing a huge, longstanding toxic dump that was poisoning the residents of a small California town. She eventually is able to produce the evidence that convicts the utility company and makes them pay nearly $400,000 to the victims. The only problem with this edition of the movie--at least for me--was the constant use of foul language. The F-word is in every other sentence of Erin's at different points in the movie, and other words are liberally sprinkled about. If that bothers you, I know there is another version that eliminates a huge amount of those words without messing with the plot. During the time Erin was really working on this case, she, too, developed medical issues from being too close to the contamination, and she really wound up in the hospital. This was filmed but never used; however, you can find a version that includes those scenes, either in situ or as an appendix. i love this movie i have watched it about 12 times and would love to watch it again and again Love this movie. Julia Roberts is fantastic. Love that this is a based on a true story. And such a great mix of drama and comedy. I absolutely love Erin Brockovich!! She is such an inspiration to not give up when times are tough! I would watch this movie over and over again if there were enough hours in the day!! I have watched this movie several times, and each time I watch it I get more out of it. Well done! This film has always been a good true story, but as usual blue ray makes the viewing experience the best. Amazons delivery system was spot on. C6 This DVD delivers on a whole new level of Corporate greed and lies. It actually epitomizes the same greed thatat corporations are doing to us today."""	Erin Brockovich

He not so much employs Barry and Dick  but rather keeps them around as they showed up at the store one day and never left. All three are vinyl and music snobs  but in different ways. Rob has a penchant for compiling top five lists. The latest of these lists is his top five break ups  it spurred by the fact that his latest girlfriend  Laura  a lawyer  has just broken up with him. He believed that Laura would be the one who would last  partly as an expectation of where he would be at this stage in his life. Rob admits that there have been a few incidents in their relationship which in and of themselves could be grounds for her to want to break up. To his satisfaction  Laura is not on this top five list. Rob feels a need not only to review the five relationships  which go back as far as middle school when he was twelve  and try to come to terms with why the woman  or girl as the case may be  left him  but also  in the words of Charlie Nicholson  number four on the list  """"what it all means"""" for why he has ended up where he is  which is nowhere  personally or professionally  close to what he envisioned. He also has to come to terms with what it means that Laura has moved on to Ian Raymond  a man for who neither had any respect when they were together.

He's too sweet/cute/fun to be true :) This movie isn't much different, just loved each minute of it. I usually get bored easily watching movies, but this one was quite fun. Definitely recommending. This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time!! John Cusack is one of the funniest people ever. He can take any roll and just by the way he acts and talks make it funnier than it should be. He has that relaxed feeling to him and that smart [aleck] personality that just makes me laugh so hard. """"High Fidelity"""" is about this guy, Rob, who just recently broke up with his girlfriend, Laura, after a good relationship that had followed a series of disaster relationships Rob had in the past. Now the only things in his life are his Used Record Store, and the two people that work with him. This could possibly be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.. The only problem is they show too much about Rob's love life than him working in the store--which the scenes in the store are the funniest parts of the movie. Watch out for Jack Black in the movie too. He played this character before he became really popular. It's probably Jack Black's best acting job yet. This movie is something you don't wanna pass up. But WARNING!! This is not a """"stupid humor"""" movie (for those of you who think because Jack Black is in it). This is a more dry, serious comedy that is more based of funny dialogue than stupid sex jokes or people falling on their faces or getting smacked with stuff. See the movie, its great. """"High Fidelity"""" runs for about 1 hour and 40 minutes. It is rated R for strong language, some sexual humor, some strong sexual content, and brief comic violence. I'm so sick of really good, really smart, funny John Cusack movies. Every year, there seems to be one more dead-on drama or romance or comedy, or some hybrid of all 3 from JC. It's starting to get old now, great performace after great performance. But while I'm here, I might as well talk about my favorite JC role yet (yup, I like this even more than Say Anything...barely). You really should hate Rob Gordon. He's a snob, he's whinny, and a bit of a jerk. But John Cusack (as usual) brings real sympathy to the character and you actually feel for him. I loved the movie, John Cusack in the movie, and all of the other memorable characters too. Jack Black was hilarious, and Todd Louiso was so adorable. Celeb cameos from Tim Robins, the Boss, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones (my fav scenes were hers...she always seems to add sparks to any movie) were dead on and allowed for most of the humor. Like with many John Cusack movies, Joan Cusack also made an appeanace. I always love that, she and him work so well together, there should have been more scenes with """"Liz"""". He also seems to have great chemistry with Lili and Catherine who he's worked with in the past, and that always helps a movie. I loved how Rob talked to the cameras constantly. I actually do that in real life...only there are no cameras, so when I do it I seem insane. But I digress...the greatest parts of the movie came with the interactions between oddly charming John and equally charming newcomer Iben Hjejle. Like everyone has stated, the sdtk rocks, and so do the DVD extras. I loved all of the deleted scenes, and wished they were in the movie. I can't wait for the inevitable Special Edition, or Collector's Edition, or Superbit Deluxe Edition, or 2-disc Special Edition...some new edition that always comes out after everyone has already bought the original. But I'd gladly shell out the ...[undisclosed dollar amount] for more extras. My wife actually watched this before I did and she said she could finally understand why I was so obsessed with music. Of course, I then had to immediately watch it and she was dead on the money!! Such a witty script and winning performances make this the pinnacle of John Cusack's career (which is really saying something). Along with """"Almost Famous,"""" this movie does the best job of showing exactly how POWERFUL music can be in someone's life, especially for a geek like me. Who else but seriously depraved people make Top 5 lists?! """"High Fidelity"""" still remains as one of my favorite comedies. Although I do have a lot of them, this is one I can watch over and over again without it getting boring or old. I am currently reading the book now, which I found that the movie follows it pretty closely at times. (Except for the location. In the book, it took place in London.) This film is about relationships, and yes, music. Rob Gordon is going through a pretty rough break-up, and he has no idea how to deal with it. He tries to play it cool and like it's really nothing, but it doesn't work. He talks to the camera, very much like Wayne in """"Wayne's World,"""" and reveals all of his worst break-ups and other information. He also owns a record store and has the """"musical moron twins"""" work for him. They don't make the break-up process any easier. Oh yeah, he constantly makes Top 5 Lists of almost anything that comes to mind. Then one day, Rob gets a fantastic idea. Why not call all of those top 5 women who broke up with him and see what happened? To his surprise, he finds out that some of the break-ups had nothing to do with him, or that he is no longer interested in them. He feels better, and they feel better. (Well, actually it's him who feels better the most, but who's counting?) All of this is a setup for one hillarious comedy about life, relationships, and yes, music. The acting is great in the movie, and is what makes it work really well. John Cusack is outstanding in the role as Rob Gordon. Jack Black is hillarious and outrageous as the cold and sarcastic Barry, who doesn't make Gordon's life any easier (one of Jack Black's best roles and performances). Other players include Lisa Bonet, Joelle Carter, Joan Cusack, Todd Louiso, Lili Taylor, and many MANY more. They all do their parts justice. The DVD is pretty neat as well. Not the best, but not the worst as well. There's a fine amount of extras, including conversations with writer/producer John Cusack and Director Stephen Frears, deleted scenes, and the theatrical trailer. The movie is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital and Widescreen Aspect Ratio 1.85:1 (which is enhanced for 16x9 TVs). If you have read the book and are a little bummed out that a lot of the funny stuff didn't make the movie, then try the deleted scenes. Chances are they are there. I really think most of them should've been left in. (Especially the part where Rob goes to buy a record collection from a vengeful wife who wants to sell them to him for a very VERY cheap price.) """"High Fidelity"""" is a hillarious ride into the mind of a guy. It's a great film filled with humor and brutal honesty. From what I have read of the book so far, the film does a good job of staying true to it, with a few subtle differences. If you're looking for a great comedy that's smart and funny, this is the one for you. John Cusack on the screen is infinitely watchable. He teams up with director Stephen Frears (Grosse Pointe Blank) again for High Fidelity and the results are nothing short of entertaining. This adaptation of Brit Nick Hornby's novel sees the world through top five and top ten lists. Cusack's character, Rob Gordon, is a man in progress, in fact a man in need of very much progress. He owns a record store, works with two other man-boy vinyl purists (well-played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso), and refuses to be committed to any one relationship or any pursuit in life. Cusack's latest love interest Laura, played by Iben Hjejle, is left wanting. The acting is left wanting and the chemistry is left wanting. The electricity is never very apparent between Cusack and Hjejle like that with Cusack and Minnie Driver in Grosse Pointe Blank. But it's a minor flaw really. There are many funny moments here. There are many hip moments here. One of the hippest being Bruce Springsteen's cameo appearance dispensing sage observations while playing an incredible blues riff. As Cusack goes hunting for someone to anchor his wandering soul, things almost rap up in the end in too neat of a package. But the minor detractions really aren't enough to keep you away, especially with music as the common thread. Needless to say we get to hear much good music as Cusack muses to the camera. This movie may not be Cusack's best, but it's right up there. Top 4 Cusack films, from best to not quite the best: Say Anything, Better Off Dead, Grosse Pointe Blank, and then this one. My top 5 lines of High Fidelity: 1. Jack Black: """"There's no way your daughter likes that record...Wait, is she in a coma?"""" 2. Jack Black: """"Let's see-ee-ee-ee"""" 3. Todd Louiso: """"You wanna talk about it...that kinda thing?"""" 4. John Cusack: """"No woman has ever had sex as great as the sex Laura is having with Ian...in my head."""" 5. John Cusack: """"What does this sentence mean to you: 'I haven't seen Evil Dead 2...Yet'""""? High Fidelity is a tour-de-force high level comedy based on Nick Hornby's presumably autobiographical novel. Most of the film's dialogue and story are taken directly from the novel, with a smooth transplant from London to Chicago. It centers around Rob's (Cusack's) obsession with his past and present relationships while set in a record store. Rob, Dick, and Barry make up a great ensemble of alternative music snobs. The film's women seem to be played with intentional airheadedness, especially Rob's past girlfriends, one a lost soul who looks to anti-depressants for peace of mind. And I'm sorry Lisa Bonet is not believable as a singer/songwriter. Anyway it's a unique original film, but I'd like to give Rob some advice: Get over it. Anyway here are my top 5 scenes of High Fidelity: 1. The gang attacks Ian (Tim Robbins) with an air-conditioner """"Get him Man!"""" 2. The ending featuring Sonic Death Monkey. 3. Discussing the Top 5 sins of otherwise great artists: I just called to say I love you. 4. Dick gets some. 5. Rob shows Dick his record collection...arranged autobiographically. The above quote is one of the many themes in this underrated masterpiece of satire and humor. However, the reason that this movie is so good is that while it seems you are prompted to agree and sympathize with the characters, you are, beneath the surface, really supposed to shake your head most of the time and utter under your breath, """"That's just sad."""" It's a movie where the characters and situations are loveable and realistic, but at the same time, are disagreeable and hard to watch, making the characters seem more like people you know than just characters. John Cusack stars as Rob Gordon, the owner of a less-than-mediocre Independent Records type store called Championship Vinyl. His two best friends, aptly knighted the """"Musical Moron Twins"""" in the film, are played by Jack Black (in his best performance...ever, I don't care how good he was in Orange County) and the lesser known, but no less talented Todd Louiso. As the film progresses, you start to feel less and less like you are watching Rob, but rather that you are standing right next to him. Most of this is because of the fact that the script is flawlessly"""	High Fidelity

This does not disappoint! Quick delivery, plays as expected. the movies are excellent... the quality of Pale Rider disk was poor.... but to be fair, after FIVE separate tries, it finally worked without skipping or stopping This is a great 3-pack. I always thought that Pale Rider was his best personal effort, but he got the Oscar for The Unforgiven. Now you can compare the two, and you have The Outlaw Josey Wales to boot. Eastwood built a Western filmography almost as great as the legend himself, John Wayne. Eastwood always looked good in the saddle and his preternatural scowl fit the High Plains well, whether in early Italian/Spanish productions with Sergio Leone, or his later personal westerns. He covers much of the same material, but his delivery gets ever better. The Unforgiven has a deconstructionist feel to it with memorable performances by Gene Hackman and Richard Harris. It was probably the most daring of his western movies, but Pale Rider has the greatest visual appeal, set against rugged backdrops that exude the romance of the Old West, like A.B. Guthrie's Big Sky novels. The Outlaw Josey Wales makes a good bridge between his early """"spaghetti"""" westerns to his later big screen performances. This was a gift I bought this for my husband....he watches it every weekend over and over again. You can never get tired of Clint Eastwood! I got these for my grandson cause in my opinion new westerns don't even compete with these older ones, My grandson really likes them. I really like """"The Outlaw Josie Wales"""" movie!!! The """"Pale Rider"""" is pretty good, just not quite as good as the Josie Wales movie, one which I know I will watch often! Eastwood is always great, a good actor and a good director, unassuming and a real person, even in his movies. I am a little disappointed in The Unforgiven. It is dark and moody. I will watch it again this weekend, as I was tired the first time I watched it, so maybe didn't 'get it.' Eastwood's acting was wonderful, as usual, but the plot was ... as I already stated ... dark and moody. Ordered these for a friend whose husband loves Westerns. They really enjoyed them If you're interested in this boxed set, then you probably are already familiar with the movies. Apart from Clint Eastwood's 'spaghetti westerns', the films in this package are amongst his best westerns. Made in three different decades, each film represents Clint Eastwood as the star and director in three different eras. 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' (1976) was Eastwood's last 70's western. In the film, Josey Wales makes his way west after the Civil War, determined to live a useful and helpful life. He joins up with a group of settlers who need the protection that a man as tough and experienced as he is can provide. Unfortunately, Josey is a wanted man and his past catches up with him. 'Pale Rider' (1985) was filmed after a 9 year western-hiatus and was his only 80's western. Here, a gold mining camp in the California foothills is besieged by a neighboring landowner intent on stealing their claims. A preacher (Eastwood) rides into camp and uses all of his powers of persuasion to convince the landowner to give up his attacks on the miners. 'Unforgiven' won critical acclaim in 1992 with four Oscars including best picture and his first best-directing gong. Eastwood stars as a retired, once-ruthless killer-turned-gentle-widower and hog farmer. He accepts one last bounty-hunter mission--to find the men who brutalized a prostitute--to help support his two motherless children. Joined by his former partner (Morgan Freeman) and a greenhorn (Jaimz Woolvett), he takes on a corrupt sheriff (Oscar winner Gene Hackman) in a showdown that makes the viewer feel the full impact of violence and its corruption of the soul. The only drawback to this product is the package itself. Although the DVD's come in a box, they are not contained in the typical plastic DVD case with the original stand-alone DVD sleave. Instead, the original stand-alone sleave is printed on a cheaper cardboard DVD case which clips into a plastic backing. I was disappointed to receive this, so I'm just letting you know. Great movies Three great westerns from across Clint's career. Clint may have got the Oscar for Unforgiven but Pale Rider is the much better movie in my opinion. The Outlaw Josey Wales fits in somewhere between those two movies. Check them out for yourself and see which you think deserves the award. Always an Eastwood fan. Old westerns are proof that movies - even shoot em up movies - can be made without all the profanity and still be GREAT! Wish Hollywood would get a clue. Not everyone lives in ghettos, does drugs, trashes other peoples property or carries guns. Some of us can even put together an intelligent sentence without a single !@#$. Received without damage to DVD's. I enjoy Eastwood westerns and these are no exceptions. He plays the man with no name in Pale Rider who comes to the rescue and in The Outlaw Josey Wales he plays a farmer who suffers from Union Soldiers and he seeks revenge. Good product, good price, fast delivery! Good product, good seller! worked great and arrived early Great videos, great videos 2 good movies Can't ever go wrong with Clint Eastwood! A+ awesome classics The outlaw Josey Wales is one of my favorite Eastwood westerns. It was good all the way through it with a pretty satisfying ending too. Pale Rider was a good one as well as most of Eastwood westerns are. Two of his best. This is an excellent set! I love these old movies and they have been fun to watch again. You just can't beat Clint Eastwood. I recon so.... Two of the great Clint Eastwood movies and I would highly recommend it for those that enjoy his movies. Thank you! good there westerns and allot of action and super gun shooter Clint, there almost as good as good, bad and ugly. what can I say, clint eastwood. freakin awesome! Great films Can't get too much of Clint....love this! Three Individually packaged discs. Nice box set. All 3 are great My son likes these old western movies. This was a Christmas Gift. After it was ordered it as delivered promptly. It was a good choice he is extremely have with dvd collection. I am thoroughly surprised by the generosity of this set. These are Clint Eastwood's best westerns! After viewing, I understood why the cinematography buffs felt disappointed. The Outlaw Josey Wales was a little grainy but the Unforgiven was clear and full. The cases for the CDs are very poor, but no worse than other CDs. This means that they must be stored carefully in a hard case. Enjoy this set, I have. If this review was helpful please add your vote. Both DVD work and show great, Thanks Two great films in one package GOOD DOUBLE FEATURE--GREAT PRICE CAME IN GREAT CONDITION , NICE STORY LINE Love it! Great combo at amazing price I have always been a Clint Eastwood fan but the cowboy movies were my favorite. I never tire of """"Outlaw Josey Wales"""". His sidekick the Chief makes the movie hilarious and memberable """"Endevor to Persevere"""" the Chief says! My grandchildren have come to love this movie as well. Though the Pale Rider is much more of a serious situation it never disappoints. A great collection for a mighty good price. Clint was the ultimate cowboy. Two great movies, great deal, these are keepers excellent quality two of his best Great good both these movies were exactly what I wanted Who couldn't Love These movies except for illegals who don't understand our language. Sorry but true? I am NOT anti-immigrant, in fact my great-great-grandfather came over from Germany in the late 1700s but they learns to adapt and English language too! very good Eastwood is the best at Westerns. These are his older works form the 60's, but they are worth watching over and over. I've seen both of these movies several times before and after viewing them both again, they are still great. I will watch them again. If anyone likes older movies that you can watch, even with your children, these would be some of them. The movies were great. I love Clint Eastwood anyway and I do like westerns.. Love them. ok Old Eastwood westerns are always pretty good. great movie set, I recommend them. I am about half way through assembling my Clint Eastwood collection and this was a great way to add two of Clint's classics on one DVD. Great flicks. No Western collection is complete without them. It was exciting and entertaining from beginning to end, I really enjoyed it very much. Clint movies Great old movies. Personally I prefer Josie Wales, but my friends like Pale Rider best, so this is just a great set regardless. nice Both Classics Good job It's Clint Eastwood in 2 great movies!! I enjoy all of Clint Eastwood's movies, these two are no exception the are very good. Arrived on time, not damaged. I've seen these movies before I wanted them for my collection both play just fine."""	Outlaw Josey Wales The

It's an absolute crime that mr. Moore is no longer with us. and the same goes for Hobson- John Gielgud's character with the dead Pan delivery of one liners and his caring nature for his care-Arthur being just perfect for this movie. It's just a fun movie that although is a laugh a minute, does have some points in it that show some hints of a serious undertone and field it expertly. I think so highly of it I own in in VHS DVD & Amazon's video streaming formats. A must see if you love to laugh funny Classic Great! The DVD arrived in excellent condition. Funny! John Gielgud's comments are the best part for me. Always good for laughs Classic fun. My husband likes it mostly. One of my all time favorites. The new one with Russell Brand sucked. Arrived in good condition. Great movie. One of the best movies from the 80's !!!! they don't make them like they use to. This is a great classic from years ago. I had forgotten how good an actor Dudley Moore really was. Too bad he is no longer with us. If you like good comedies then this movie is for you. It is a welcome addition to my film collection. """"Not all of us drink because we are poets,..... some of us drink because we are not poets"""" -Arthur Bach Bullseye ! 6 stars One of the funniest characters in cinema history Must have classic for your comedy collection. We've loved this movie for years. Nice to be able to watch it whenever we want. Dudley at his best! May he be resting in peace. One of the all time classics. Makes me laugh every time! """" Don't you just hate Perry's wife!"""" Great lines. Line it up with Ghost Busters, Caddy Shack etc. Great movie always have love it! Very nice One of the greatest romantic comedies in the history of cinema Dudley at his peak - best. A rare classic. What happens when you have too much $$$!!! c I loved it what more can I say? This has always been in my top ten funny movies of all time. Dudley Moore is hysterical and the story is fantastic. The cars in this picture are wonderful as well. One of the most difficult portrayals for any actor is to act drunk. Dudley Moore nailed it. Grab a bottle of scotch, a glass with ice and plug this in and enjoy. A classic. Love this movie Very sweet, funny, timeless Romantic comedy !!! Great production design, music .. Great cast.. Dudley Moore and Liza Manelli are wonderful ! This is one of the funniest movies ever made and it too often gets over-looked when people make these top movie lists. what a funny movie I watched the movie when it first came out in the movies. I thought it was hysterical back then. Watching again, years later . . . . it was just okay. Seems to have lost it's appeal a little. Dudley Moore is SUPERB! You can watch this a million times. and he is still funny and engaging. great movie funny Awesomely funny movie. Love Dudley! I adore Dudley Moore in this movie and the condition of the DVD is perfect ! It arrived quickly too ! Thank you so much !! Dudley Moore was awesome in this!! Very Very funny and tastefully done as well as a little sad. Such fun to watch - loved it yesterday and today. A classic for sure! Love One of my favorite movies of all time! Awesome movie great product fast on time delivery Arthur is an overgrown child in a 40something body that refuses to grow up. His parents and grandmother have pre-arranged a marriage to very wealthy heiress Susan, a well intended, but too straight laced match for the juvenile delinquent Arthur. He needs to resolve himself to the marriage because the resulting union will result in over a billion dollar estate. The movie opens with Arthur drunkenly babbling in the back seat of his 500,000 cream colored Rolls Royce, looking for company on the streets of New York. He eventually ends up home with a lady of the night where Arthur's servant, Hobson, quickly expels the lady. The two banter and it's obvious they've known each other since Arthur was a boy. He sort of follows directions from Arthur with the ever present brilliant humor that the English are so well known for. Arthur is at a fifth avenue men's store when he spots Linda Morolla, a very cute, witty, and bubbly waitress in New York. She is caught stealing a tie, and on the way out of the building a security stops her. Arthur follows her out and intercedes and saves her, but after he forces a kiss from her, claiming he's her husband. What ensues are the antics the two engage in while Arthur painfully moves closer to his wedding date to the very wealthy, innocent Susan ultra rich heiress. Susan's father basically intimidates Arthur and tells him after marriage he will employ him in his business and """"straighten him out."""" Arthur faces a major dilemma in his life. Does he want to fulfill the family destiny and create a billion dollar dynasty, or chase after the cute, smart girl waitress from the Bronx? You'll have to watch the movie and find out. While the humor and surroundings are dated, the story is still beautiful and very funny and witty. Highly recommended. Great classic great movie, hands down one of the funniest ever made. Great This classic comedy never gets old. We have loved this movie for decades. fun Love the movie and am happy with the condition of the DVD. One of my all time favorites Best movie ever - happy to finally own it ! What can I say, Fantastic! Classic!!!!!!!!!! funny Hilarious and charming! Loved every minute of it. From the plight of a lonely, drunkard and troubled playboy, we see the story of how one man falls in love with a woman he saves from a shoplifting scheme. Dudley Moore is perfect in this role, and you almost feel sorry for him, despite is upper-class and affluence. His role is augmented by his succinct and brutally honest butler, who attempts to keep him on the straight and narrow, but often fails. Would definitely recommend. I enjoy watching Classic Comedy Movie. It's such a joy to be able to go back and remember things such as this. Like they say, It's never going to be, Like old times again. I'm glad to have purchased this. Please don't drink and drive. i have always loved this move and was glad to get it again. I haven't seen it in years! They can remake this movie a hundred times but they'll never get another actor to play Arthur as hilariously as Dudley Moore. He was so good, he raises this movie to a new level, with his pixilated millionaire who drinks way too much and spoils himself rotten, and the butler, brilliantly portrayed by the staid British Shakespearean actor, John Gielgud. Those two get involved in the life of young Liza Minelli, who shoplifts in order to get a birthday gift for her father. Classic Dudley makes being an alcoholic seem like fun Funny stuff. Classic movie. The disc plays just fine, and did I mention it's reeeeaally funny? One of my favorite all-time movies. Great Movie Great movie Omg hilarious LOVE THIS MOVIE! Love it, Dudley Moore at his finest. I love his movies. This movie and 10 are my favorites of his. Funniest movie ever great Just as funny today as when it first came out Dudley Moore does a great job. Very funny movie. I bought this because this is one of my husband's favorite movies. This is a hilarious movie I watched it many times. This is the great comedy that I have watched hundreds of times while working, and I don't even have to see the screen anymore! Comedies rarely are this well done anymore, as you can too plainly see from the lame remake attempt, or even the horrendous sequel that arrived later, like buzzards to a wedding feast. Other people can analyze this to death for you, but I will say: see it once, and you will want your own copy! Original. This movie was one of my favorite movies in my teens/20's... still love it - Dudley and troupe just nail it. The music sets off endorphins in mh soul This movie has been part of my family for generations. We quote it at family functions and it never gets old. This is the TRUE CLASSIC.. Forget Russel Brand... This is one of Moore's best films.. It is about a rich man being forced into a relationship with a woman he does not love.. But when he is told that his money will be cut off if he and Susan do not wed.... One of the fondest memories of childhood comes back in this classic... Hobson was my favorite as he was more of a dad to Arthur then the person's real dad... This movie will make you laugh and cry... The newer version will NEVER be as good as this one... Arthur is one that never gets old... If your feeling nostalgic for a funny old movie it delivers. i think most older people saw the movie when we were young and wished we were him. Now that I'm older I'm glad it was only a movie and I'm not. He's really a mess and in the movie it makes him likable but in real life it would be bad. Didn't mean to get to serious. It's only a movie enjoy An oldie but a goodie! A funny, endearing if even a little sad movie that still really makes you laugh, cry and just shows us a fallible human being. Best comedy! One of the best comedies ever made. (Don't bother with the remake.) Excellent Great movie - timeless humor. Good Movie One of the funniest movies of all times. classic Perfectly cast and wonderfully heartfelt. Didn't like the sequel and will never watch the remake but I'll toss this in the DVD player again. Really funny movie! Dudley Moore is a loveable, hilarious drunk in this classic 80's movie. We've seen this movie a 1/2 dozen times and will watch it again. FANTASTIC!A must watch again and again! Watching it again @ Amazon Instant vid! Dudley and Liza @ their Best in NYC! Hey, the best that they can do is fall in love! :) This one by far beats out the remake with Russell Brand. Dudley Moore was genius at comedy. I'm not a fan of Mineli, but she was good in this as was all the players. I am happy with this purchase. everything was good and as promised. this has to be one of my favorite movies ever made , way too funny. a must have for every video library :) Good movie Still a very funny and enjoyable flick. Dudley did a great job with acting like a drunk and Lisa played off him well. Just about the most """"warm and wonderful"""" movie ever made. A true classic in every sense. If you haven't seen it, drop everything and sit back and enjoy. I was very pleased with the shipment and the quality of the VHS. I love this movie and it was worth buying it. I was very pleased with this purchase. Dudley Moore WAS Arthur -- and this is one of the greatest buddy movies of all time (in spite of Liza Minnelli: I can't say I will ever understand how she got this part). Anyway, fabulous movie. Dudley Moore did the best Arthur. I enjoy watching this movie time and again. I was glad to have found it"""	Arthur
8898	"The Wingo family is from South Carolina  they growing up in a house on a tidal plain. The oldest offspring  Lucas  largely acted as the protector for his younger twins siblings  Tom and Savannah  in light of their dysfunctional growing up  with their shrimper father  Henry  distant and abusive if when he did pay them any attention  and their mother  Lila  while not doting on them most concerned about appearances and striving for social standing. Now in middle age  Savannah is a New York based poet  Tom  still living on the South Carolina coast outside of Charleston with his wife Sally and their own three doting daughters  taking a break from his high school teaching football coaching job  while Lucas has long since died while still standing up for himself and his beliefs. Lila  divorced and now remarried with that wealth and social standing she so long desired  receives news that Savannah is in the hospital following her most recent suicide attempt. Not wanting to face the blame directly as she suspects  she assigns Tom to go to New York to speak to Savannah's therapist  Susan Loewenstein  to provide any information of a family history nature that could help in Savannah's recovery. Tom agrees despite hating New York  and it being not a good time since he and Sally are experiencing marital problems  they both just knowing that things between them are not working  and not having been intimate in months. As Tom and Loewenstein (as he calls her) begin their sessions  Tom is slow to divulge the Wingo family problems to her. But he learns that she too is having her own family problems  with her concert violinist husband Herbert Woodruff being self absorbed and condescending  with their young adult son  Bernard  hating both largely because of they predestining his life also as a concert violinist. Tom and Loewenstein's sessions blossom into a friendship and romance  where their talks  in addition to helping Savannah  may help them both in dealing with their own life problems  Tom's which have been long buried figuratively and literally.Drama Romance , adaptation adapted-from:book based-on-a-book based-on-book book books dysfunctional-family love-story new-york psychiatrist psychiatry ,""Not too bad for the most part, though the ending is pretty unconvincing. The cynical, distant Nick Nolte goes to NYC after his twin sister (played by Melinda Dillon) there tries to commit suicide. He begins seeing her psychiatrist (Barbra Streisand) and through flashbacks we learn about the demons of his family's past - all of which he's learned to suppress his whole life. Conveniently Nolte's wife (Blythe Danner) takes up with another man while Nolte is falling in love with Streisand; at the end he returns to his wife though he still loves Streisand. Nolte is excellent in his role, and as is often the case when he's on screen, his persona dominates every scene he's in; Streisand is fairly bland in comparison. The movie begins to show its weaknesses after Nolte and Streisand fall in love: where the movie should be exploring their love and """"obligations"""" in a hard, meaningful way, it only goes soft and paisley romantic. Why Nolte goes back to his wife, why she even wants him back, is hardly touched on; instead we get the throwaway lines, """"You love her more,"""" says Streisand; """"No,"""" replies Nolte, """"just longer."""" Not a whole lot of substance there. I have seen this film a number of times, realized I wanted a copy to keep. While Pat Conroy's books are too often """"over-written,"""" including PRINCE OF TIDES -- I still love this particular book, and the script for the film -- brava to Streisand. And Nick Nolte is marvelous! This is the place to go to buy your favorite older movies when you're still switching out from VHS to DVD. A great movie at a great price delivered right to your door! If you have never seen the movie , you are going to be in shock as to the sensivity that the movie embraces. This is a movie that everyone should see. I have watched this movie a couple times , as well read the book. It is based on true story and well described. It shows the reality that boys too can be raped. It is countless how many times I have seen this movie. There is one rough scene with the children, but other than that, it is a wonderful movie and one of her best. Will she ever be recognized as one of the best directors? We all should have an open mind about ourselves & others. We never know what our friends are going through just because they have a smile on their face. This movie opens up Pandora's box for just about each one in the movie. I thought it was well played, good dialog and well accepted. It makes you think, and enjoy life a little more. Take a look at yourself & laugh. I bought this movie for my mom because she loves this movie and also loves the book. She has really enjoyed watching it over and over again. The movie was okay, but not my favorite. Both are super actors, but it was not my kind of movie. This film surprised me. I think great acting and a great story and of course the visuals in this film all make it excellent, too. Nolte at his finest...Streisand should have won """"Best Director"""" for this movie...normally not into 'chick flicks' but this was to me more than that...it had a story...with a great title! This movie is Streisand's best, and ditto for Nick Nolte. It's the story of Tom Wingo. It is the story of passion and love and hate and fear and redemption. Based on Pat Conroy's brilliant novel it is mesmerizing and touches the heart in a way that no other movie has quite managed to do. I love this movie and if you are a Barbra Streisand fan it is worth buying...It is a movie I enjoy watching over and over again. Loved the way it was written and the acting was excellent. Highly recommend it to people who love a serious story. Still great after all these years!!! Love the South Carolina lowcountry. Beautiful country - beautiful people. This story brought me back to some great memories!!! Sensible and poignant melodrama about an alcoholic. With a sumptuous reference frame, Streisand made possibly her finest masterpiece. Penetrating script with a towering acting of Nick Nolte. GREAT MOVIE! GREAT TAKE ON THE BOOK! BUY IT! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! YOU WISH IT WOULD'NT END THATS HOW GREAT A MOVIE IT IS!!! so I ordered it. I had read the book and have seen the movie when originally released. It was a nice rainy afternoon movie and I was glad to experience it again. It certainly provides an example of how unaddressed violence and violation can create wounds that can haunt victims until they find a voice to speak about what happened. I have already reviewed this movie as I have all that follow on the listing. They are all good movies and received in great condition. They make a good addition to my collection. Thank you for very good service. The Prince of Tides is an interesting movie. The cover picture does not convey the correct picture of what the movie is about. Frankly, the love affair between those two is a small part of the film. The film is more about Nick Nolte character's memories of his childhood, considering that Barbara's character is trying to figure out why Nolte's character twin sister is suicidal. In fact, Nolte's character is so affected by his own childhood that he needs to find his way; in the end he does. Amazing movie; I think that Nick Nolte is at his best in this movie. Wish there could be a sequel. Solid script and directing, great acting, good story, and exceptionally lovely photography. I confess to being a fan of Streisand and Nolte. Get the wide screen edition and enjoy. The item arrived very quickly. I got it for my grandmother- it is one of her favorite movies. The disk played without skipping. One of my favorite movies. I've watched it on TV many times, and decided I should just buy it! Nick Nolte was the perfect choice for the lead, and Barbra Streisand is a very good actress. For mature adults - even guys. Happy with it more because it's a good movie, nothing I really paid for. Very emotional film, but very good. The quality of this movie was great. I really enjoyed Streisand and Nolte as the stars in this film and it is definitely a deep movie. So prepared to be touched. Thanks, Samantastar I really like this movie, it makes touches me . The DVD was recently purchased to replace the VHS copy I had... Barbara and Nick did a great job on this! The story told what can happen when secrets are kept. Great I WATCHED THIS MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE EARLY 90S AND WAS AMAZED AT WHAT A WONDERFUL PICTURE IT IS. THE FILM WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE, BEST ACTOR FOR NICK NOTLE AND BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS FOR KATE NELIGAN - UNFORTUNATELY, MISS STRIESAND WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR BEST DIRECTOR, WHICH SURELY IS A MISFORTUNE BECAUSE IT WAS SHE WHO COAXED THESE MARVELOUS PERFORMANCES FROM THESE ACTORS. WATCH IT AND LOVE IT. BEAUT IFULL STORY. NICE MOVIE Enjoyable and interesting movie but a rather unrealistic situation with the therapist -- perhaps if she'd been more of an ordinary psychologist and not quite so Barbra, exuding glamour and wealth. (How would the sister afford this kind of woman?) Nick Nolte is fascinating to watch. I thought the flashback scenes were not quite as raw as they could have been, to portray the level of trauma. I don't mean that I needed to see more gory detail, but it often felt more like a play than real. And Nolte's healing came a little too quickly -- he would surely be more screwed up than this as an adult. Thank you Well acted, but depressing. This film is still beautiful to watch, even after so many years. I loved Pat Conroy's book, The Prince of Tides. I looked forward to the film version. Nick Nolte was an inspired choice to play Tom Wingo. I have no qualms with the rest of the cast. I, too, wish that more of the story (of Luke especially) could have been told. But, I have no major problem with the screenplay and the direction served the script fine. My problem is that Streisand as producer and director should have read the damn book a little closer when it came to the character of Lowenstein, the psychiatrist. She was described as upper-class, slim & dark, cultured, refined & immaculate. Now, Barbra may be interesting & intelligent....but classy and refined she ain't. Not with footlong violet fingernails that would rival the Dragonlady's. Maybe if I hadn't read the book, it would have worked...but I doubt it. Casting in a movie is half the battle. And that her ego allowed her to cast herself in this role says more about Barbra's delusions than it does her talent. She told the story well, but the great love and understanding between Wingo and Lowenstein just wasn't believable for me between Nolte and Streisand. Too bad, because she handled the rest of the movie pretty well. I only wrote this because Barbra did a lot of bitching at the time that she was overlooked at Oscar time for Best Director. I truly feel that had she cast that role to someone else and JUST directed, she would have made the list. But, she had to make the movie a Barbra Streisand movie starring Barbra and thereby sank it rom potentially great to just a good film. Ego will get you every time. 3-1/2 stars. Got these as a gift for my partner. She loved the movies and the tin container for the movies. Great addition to any DVD collection I agree with the previous writers. How can I buy this when I don't know what it contains? A """"tin"""" in and of itself doesn't mean a thing to me. What's on the discs? It is one disc or four? Are there any extras? What version are we getting? Come on Amazon; come clean with this item. What IS it? Great value, saved $'s. All fun and worth the view. Barbara strived to be someone as she was growing up in Flatbush. She was always told that she couldn't do this, wouldn't be this, and with that nose........ Barbara gives a performance of dignity and determination. Her personal belief and life's experiences are interwoven in this production. The Price of Tides.......it will make you proud and give you hope. This movie is for any Streisand fan to watch. The casting of Barbra as a New York psychiatrist is excellent as Nolte as a football coach who comes to New York to help is sister who tried to commit suicide. Tom played by Nick Nolte falls in love with Barbra's character Dr. Lowenstein, both are married but not happily. I'll save the ending for the movie. The music, the acting including Barbra's son Jason Gould is high caliber. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a well done movie, this is one heck of a movie. Barbra you did it again!! i have little good to say about this movie. as a therapist myself, i feel the therapist in this movie was repugnant...totally unethical in sleeping with her patient...obviously an emotionally disturbed woman. to analyze it just a bit, i can't help but think that it was the writer's fantasy that their therapist have sex with them...any good therapist would tell you that what barbra streisand's character did would ultimately prove very destructive to the patient. yet this movie stated that it was okay for her to have sex with him...because he """"wasn't really her patient."""" well, for starters, it's equally BAD THERAPY for her to have sex with...a patient's brother...but the"""	Prince of Tides The
8902	"""New York based writer Gwen Cummings knows that she drinks a lot  doesn't believe it's a problem  and if she finally decides that it is that she could stop drinking without issue. She and her live in boyfriend Jasper fuel each other's hyperactivity with this excessive alcohol consumption  """"a normal life"""" which is not in either's vocabulary for themselves. Between Gwen and her older straight laced sister Lily  Gwen more closely resembles who was their larger than life mother  who was also an addict and who died when they were children. Lily believes that Gwen's alcohol consumption makes her a difficult if not impossible person to love. While Gwen is in a drunken stupor at Lily's wedding  Gwen causes one issue after another  ruining the day for Lily. Gwen is forced to examine her drinking with the culmination of bad events she caused at the wedding  leading to her being court ordered to enter into rehab for twenty eight days  which is only marginally more tolerable an idea to her than the alternative  which is jail. For Gwen to make any progress  she has to acknowledge that she has a problem which requires the support during those twenty eight days not only of the facility's staff  but also the other patients  each who is going through his her own issue with respect to the demons of addiction. If she does eventually acknowledge the problem  she will also have to reconcile the events of her life with Lily  and come to the realization that a life with Jasper is not in her best interest if she has any chance of surviving outside of the facility after those twenty eight days. ""Drama , addiction alcoholism drama drinking drug-abuse drug-addiction ,""Great acting, as always, with Sandra Bullock. Thank you, great Its a good movie. What a great movie. I bought this for my work as I am a substance abuse counselor. We like to show movie of those struggling with addiction. Good deal too. good great movie One of my favorite movies. Watched it so many times. ok Always a favorite,I felt the struggle,saw the damage,saw the win! Nicely done! We watch it a couple of times a year. I love Sandra and she's great in this. The movie is OK, IMHO Great movie Sandra Bullock is great. The script is sensitive to the issues of substance dependency. The supporting actors and the director are fantastic. Interesting movie Good Movie highlighting additions. Would recommend. Love Sandra Bullock so enjoy all of her movies. I'm very happy with my order. It looks n plays fine. Great movie about recovery in the early stages. Sandra Bullock really plays her part very well! Story very realistic. Very contemporary Very good movie about substance abuse. Very informative if you are an addict or alcoholic or work in the substance abuse filed. Sandra is indead talented,she just never got the perfect role to show it to us! Well here it is! And she did dammn good work! Her best film since """"Practical Magic"""" with a serious theme but also funny in a way! At her side the terrific good acting """"Elizabeth Perkins"""" who playes Sandy's Sister! This picture contens some very imotional scenes and some terrible funny ones! I cant wait to hold this DVD in my hands! A must see! This movie is one of the best movies of Sandra I have seen. She plays a alcoholic, who needs to find herself again in rehab, that is why the name """"28 days"""". Why is this movie so good? Well, it shows you how the real world can be, and that it isn't always much fun as it looks. My favourite part of the movie is where Gwen (Sandra) plays a part of the hot series """"Santa Cruz"""". She has these curly things in her hair, and plays a magic role as Dorian. She does this for her roommate, who is almost leaving rehab. Of course there are more funny bits in the movie, but also serious parts. But you have to acctualy see it, because I am not going to tell you more. In my last sentence I just wanted to let everyone know that YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE! Good for People who need to be grounded In the hands of an unsympathetic director and an ego-crazed star, """"28 Days"""" could have turned into an uninspired vehicle for award season. In the hands of director Betty Thomas and star Sandra Bullock, """"28 Days"""" is a masterful work of brutal honesty and bittersweet comedy that never loses it's dramatic edge. Bullock plays Gwen Cummings, a party animal like no other. Her wild antics spoil her sister's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding, not to mention causing a nice family the hassle of rebuilding their front porch. She is sentenced to 28 days in Serenity Glen, a sort of new wave rehabilitation clinic. The rest of the story should be experienced on screen as we see Gwen struggle from denial to opposition to acceptance and finally to a slow healing. She can't promise us, or herself for that matter, that her recovery will be swift. What she does do is take one day at a time and fight one battle at a time...a lesson that all of us can apply to our every day lives. Sandra Bullock gives the absolute best performance of her career. She will make you laugh and she will make you cry, but what she does best is make you think and feel even if the thoughts and emotions are unwanted. She is absolutely flawless in this film. Further kudos should go to Betty Thomas for her edgy direction and screenwriter Susannah Grant (""""Erin Brockovich"""") for hitting another one out of the park. Great price Great Recovery Movie! A little outdated. Treatment programs have changed. But a great movie about addiction. Sandra is marvelous. We get positive responses when shown in group therapy. FLUFF PIECE FOR CHILDREN If you want to stay sober, by this DVD and watch it. It will remind you of why you don't want to take that first drink. One of my favorite movies. The movie was kinda raggedy - full of ups and downs - how to end it? Well it turns out - one of the best endings of all time - will be in my mind forever. Not a good movie at all Funny! k There's a bit of humor associated with addiction, Sandra Bullock is awesome as always! Watch this over and over in my alcohol education classes. Great recovery film. Ms. Bullock does a good job with her character. It's funny, sad and uplifting! Fine I am very satisfied with this purchase. Funny, and real life as I worked in a Detox unit and many treatment facilities, this stuff actually happens in treatment. Kid love this film! ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES AND SANDRA BULLOCK JUST PLAYS HER CHARACTERS SO NATURALLY SO BELIEVABLY.GREAT! SHE SHOULD GET AN OSCAR FOR HER WORK EACH MOVIE IS SUCH A MOVING WORK.SHE IS SO BELIEVABLE.LOVE HER! This movie is great! It is one of my favorite movies. When I got the movie in the mail it was not like new like it said. They also did not have a replacement for it. I had to buy the movie from another place. The movie it self was very enjoyable. I love Sandra Bullock. This movie touches on reality, plus areas of funny and serious. I would recommend to all. Excellent movie to show when you have a substance abuse group who just needs a good laugh at the things they have done while abusing substances and in rehab. Sandra Bullock shines in this movie about recovery Good movie Excellent movie Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job in this one It can be a real life situation and has a lot of emotions in it that we can relate to The ending is not what you would expect but good I would highly recommend this movie ok I love Sandra Bullock & some of the other actors as well. I thought it had the right balance of drama & comedy. It was very thought-provoking. Overall a nice movie. You can't really go far wrong getting this movie with supporting cast, that alone will keep the movie stable and of course, Sandra Bullock, as always great. The movie is actually a serious subject and its done, not perfect but pretty well. Addiction is tough to handle for everyone and it comes across here, maybe a little too lightly but it works. Nice movie. Sandra Bullock is at her best. Great story for those who know people with a drinking problem. Hits all the right bases. Homerun! Love this movie! How do you not love Sandra Bullock? 28 days dragged by in the beginning but when she connected with a couple of people she cared about instead of just herself, the movie became truly believable--if you could afford that rehab. Great movie! Highly recommend it, since it was very true to life! Loved it then, love it more now!! I'm a substance abuse counselor and have several years experience in the residential treatment setting. This movie is a perfect portrayal of the depth of the relationships that are able to be formed between people in only 28-days when they are sharing their most humbling experiences with one-another. Beautifully done! Addiction doesn't care if you are smart, pretty, and capable; it will take you if it can. But like the saying goes, sometimes all the wrong choices lead you to exactly the right places. This film gives an accurate portrayal of addiction, treatment, and recovery, with a little """"added"""" humor. Just real enough. A tough topic addressed with compassion and humor. Sandra does a great job. This is one of my favorite Taiwanese dramas! I'm a huge fan of both Jerry and Ella, they have Greg chemistry together! Here's a funny, sweet, and silly take on rehab starring Sandra Bullock and a great cast. I love this movie. I enjoyed Sandra Bullock in her role as a drunk who was out of control and rehab at its best. She pulled this one off with no problem. While this certainly was an emotional journey, and I myself am simply a big fan of drug rehab movies (we've all got our stuff), I have three complaints: Buscemi needed a bigger roll, baseball man needed a much smaller role, and it should have ended when she walked into her apartment at the end. Then again, I didn't write the dern thing so I might as well grin and bear it - and that's easy to do when the acting, writing, and characters are so realistic (yet pleasantly fictionalized) as those in 28 Days. Enjoy this movie! It's definitely worth the watch! Then again, if you absolutely can't stand a few predictable moments or cliches, and maybe you're tired of the superficiality of the big, strong, adorably flawed """"better man"""" (although they did seem to play well with how that issue ended) among the rest of a good movie, you might just want to rent it for your laptop for a slightly cheaper price. The lessons I believe this movie tries to teach are pretty clear and well-known, but still nice to see: everyone needs a helping hand at some point, life is about more than dulling the senses for the sake of a good time, and sometimes the hardest thing to do is exactly what will heal us - in this case, to face the reality of what we've become and how most of the time we're the only ones to blame... I am glad I bought this movie; I had never heard of it before, it was just an impulse buy. I just watched it, had to break out the tissues just once, and I'm looking forward to the special features. God bless! You might like this movie if you: a) Love Sandra Bullock b) If you are an addict c) You get all nostalgic about the worst time of your life I am being a little facetious about """"worst time"""" of your life. Like many, I love Sandra Bullock. Like many I am an addict. Like many I have been to Rehab. You don't have to be a drunk to like this movie, but it doesn't hurt. You might like it more if it triggers bittersweet memories of your own recovery process. I liked it on both levels but """"normal"""" people might not. I like this film, which can be a cleaner version of drug and alcohol addiction. Sandra Bullock and Viggo Mortensen are terrific but the film can be unrealistic regarding drugs and alcohol and becoming clean in 28 days. It follows the AA model and clearly a """"white"""" addiction and fails to address the revolving door that any addiction can resume and lacks the prostitution aspect. However, the film displays usual facets of addiction recovery which can be relationship development, sabotage and a lack of the impact with family system development by only blaming the addict, and not addressing the vital forces of trauma, mental illness and co-dependency with addiction. Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is out of control. A self-proclaimed Alcoholic and part-time drug user, she has completely destroyed her sister's wedding. After arriving forty-five minutes late as the maid of honor, making an embarrassingly bad toast, demolishing the four-layer wedding cake, and finally stealing a limousine and driving it to its destruction, Gwen finds herself sentenced to twenty-eight days in rehab. There, she begins to bond with her screwed-up teenage roommate, but finds the other people in her group almost unbearable. Her life changes as she experiences ups and downs"""	28 Days

Anna  whom they knew when they were younger  comes back to town a stunning woman. Jake is up to be the head of his synagogue but he is not married which doesn't make his appointment any easier. Jake finds himself attracted to Anna but because she's not Jewish  he can't marry her as it would make his appointment less likely. Brian also finds himself attracted to Anna  but the priesthood doesn't allow that. Their friendship is strained when each learns of the other's feelings for her.Comedy Drama Romance , catholicism chick-flick comedy feel-good-movie feel-good friendship funny girlie-movie good good-romantic-comedies great love-story new-york original relationships religion romance romantic romantic-comedy sweet unlikely-friendships ,""You know those old Doris Day cuties? Well this is like one of those...just precious. The song at the end is too cute so I put it on a CD and listen to it when I feel like kissing a boy again. Chick flick deluxe! Enjoy ladies! Keeping the Faith is a romantic comedy about a love triangle. But the two guys are a priest and a rabbi. I didn't buy the Stiller/Elfman romance and Stiller was quite the jerk, letting his religious belief keep him from the woman he loves. And she was a jerk for beginning the process of conversion (which was implied near the ending). I don't get religion and couldn't relate to the characters. The movie was average and had some good laughs. But the religious angle just kills it for me. Keeping the Faith was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Edward Norton, and Ben Stiller among others. The plot has elements of both comedy and drama, though it fails to take off. The story is really not that great (it's rather uninteresting unless you're big into political correctness and """"cultural diversity"""" in which case by all means this is your film), while the humor and the acting are just about average. The movie brings to the screen the story of three friends who reunite after several years only to have the two guys fall for the girl and all that that entails. On the positive side, it's always a pleasure to watch Edward Norton, and Ben Stiller. On the negative side, this film does not seem to be Jenna Elfman's thing. She seems a bit out of place. In a nutshell, it's an ok movie if you've got nothing else to do, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top. No masterpiece here. For great Edward Norton films check out American History X, 25th Hour, Fight Club, and Kingdom of Heaven, while for Ben Stiller, Zoolander, Dodgeball, Meet the Parents, and Madagascar. Probably a """"Chick Flick"""" but I think everyone who has any grey hair will have a big smile the whole movie. great movie- came quickly. I watch this movie every couple of years and it is always enjoyable. Accidentally ordered this. I already own it! its ok happy Yes I loved this movie very well done. I have to admit I started watching this movie with a less than positive attitude. My previous encounters with Ben Stiller were either getting certain appendages stuck in zippers or having crocodilian's crispy heads removed geek style. I recognized Jenna Elfman from """"Krippendorf's Tribe"""" (1998). So I was ready for some wasted film. After holding my breath and waiting for it to hit. I soon realized that this was a well put together movie with a good story plot and excellent execution. I was amazed at the people that were in this movie. Half the time I keep saying """"oh look there is"""" Anne Bancroft, Eli Wallach, and many others. Basic story of three childhood friends. One went away and the other two chose to become (now don't laugh) a priest and a rabbi. The one that went away (Anna Riley) returns as a business executive and has a magnetic personality with accoutrements to match. The fun and the drama is when two and a half become more than friend. How will they and their world react to this? What makes the movie is not the story as much as how it is executed. And it seems that I need to re-evaluate Ben Stiller as he did a fine job with just the minimum of """"spectacles, testicles, watch, wallet"""". great movie Remember that joke about the Rabbi and the Priest? Well, someone in Hollywood decided to make a movie out of it and while the casual observer may think that it would be difficult to make a successful movie on such a flimsy topic, it works and pulls at your heartstrings. Jake Schramm and Brian Finn had been friends since their childhood. Every since they were kids Jakes has wanted to be a rabbi. He even had a set of All-Star Rabbi collecting cards! Brian has also been religious his whole life. Growing up as kids, a tomgirl by the name of Anna Riley came into their little New York life and soon the 3 became inseperable. However, fate would have it that Anna's parents were moving to the sunshine of California, crushing the bond between the three friends. Still, life goes on and 20 years later, we catch up with the two hip religious figures, now serving their own faiths as Priest and Rabbi. One of the subplots is that they want to build a Inter-faith community center because they feel that if they can be friends, religious denomination should not a dividing point amongst people. Jake is the dating phase, being set up by every Jewish mother and her sister, while Brian is living a satisfying celibate life with God as his companion. However this is turned upside down when Anna, on a business trip to New York, calls them up to catch up. She has turned into a radiant business woman who has kept enough of her quirkiness to make her irresistible to both men. Jake, who starts dating her, begins to develop commit issues because she is not Jewish (which might affect his chance of becoming head rabbi at his synagogue) and Brian begins questioning his faith in the Catholism because he has fallen in love so hard that he feels he has lost his commitment to religion. All three characters are played well. Jenna Elfman is the best as the irresistable Anna Riley. She gives her character so much charisma and is luminous on screen. Edward Norton is also very good as the sensitive priest who becomes hurt and discouraged when he realizes what he thought was sexual flirtation is actually just playfulness. Ben Stiller plays the it straight as the Rabbi, but he tends to become """"less than a man"""" as he whines through his dilemma about interfaith relationships. All three of them have tremendous amounts of chemistry (as friends and lovers) and it makes the movie even more endearing. So, when this movie comes out near Halloween and you are sick of watching yet another slasher brain-drain flick, give this movie a chance....Rating: B+ ps: Don the Crazy Chinese Karoake salesperson steals the movie! He is well played Ken Leung. A Must See My hubby and I really enjoyed this movie. You can't beat this film with a stick. These three, at their ages when this film was made with Anne Bancroft and the other members of this wonderful, wonderful ensemble is a 7 out of 5. It's one of my all time favorite Hollywood films as well as Ben Stiller films. He was given a meaty role and pulled it off with Edward Norton. A rabbai (Stiller) and a priest (Norton) and their friend (Jenna Elfman) who is luminous and floats in to town to bewitch both. Mom (Bancroft) """"gets"""" her and the story plays out. Ya got to see this one if you haven't. It's not a typical rabbai, priest with a comedy twist at all. You'll love it. It's about Keeping the Faith. Good movie! Romantic, funny, and Religious, too. Another for work only item. It fit the bill. Excellent service. Such a great movie!! Love it! I love Ed Norton and I wanted to love this movie but it was just okay for me. I love it. It's got a little bit of everything. It makes you laugh a lot, but it's still real life relatable. An entertaining, thoughtful movie. It is very different from Ben Stiller's """"museum"""" films. It shows Edward Norton's skills as a director. I've watched this movie so many times I just had to buy it. It is wonderfully funny and I love all the actors. Love it. I have always liked this film - Ben and Edward nail their parts, there is humor, love, angst, faith, beautiful Jenna - it's a well done ride. Great movie for a laugh. Also some very tender moments in the film! I would watch it over and over again! A priest and a rabbi... sounds like the beginning of a joke, but it's this movie... I adore this movie - it's sweet, and funny, and the actors are great. What's not to love about a movie where Ben Stiller and Ed Norton are religious friends who are in competition for the love of Jenna Elfman? This is a great movie that takes an interesting look at relationships and faith. I first watched it with my daughter when she was a teenager and it was a nice opening for conversation. I just watched it again now ten years later because it was so good! This is a fun movie I enjoy the actors and had this movie on video and was wanting to watch it again I am glad I know have it on DVD. This is a beautiful, sensitive film that addresses issues both spritual and secular, and it manages to do it all with amazing humor! It's a movie you'll want to watch again and again and share with friends and family. great movie - good quality If you are home sick and have absolutely nothing else more pressing to do, """"Keeping the Faith"""" is a nice little diversion for 2 hours. Ben Stiller is more or less Ben Stiller, with a few moments of actual minimal dramatic moments which he carries off quite well. Jenna Elfman is beautiful, lively, and has a long career ahead of her...on television. Ann Bancroft plays a less serious version of the same """"Jewish Mother"""" she played opposite Harvey Fierstein in """"Torch Song Trilogy"""", and she is absolutely adorable, as always. It was an added treat to see the brilliant director, Milos Foreman, grace the screen as the wise old mentor to the young priest played by Edward Norton. And as his counterpart at the Temple, Eli Wallach is charming as the soon-to-be retired Rabbi giving counsel to renegade Rabbi Jake. However, my favorite in this assorted pool of talent was Ron Rifkin, as the Temple President eager to boot Ben Stiller from the Bimah and Temple. Due to his immense talent, show-biz connections & charming personality Edward Norton was able to assemble a terrific cast for his directorial debut. And for a freshman filmmaker he did a good job...a solid B+. I have no doubt Mr. Norton will someday make other films and it will be fun to compare them to his debut in this comic romp. FYI: If you are looking for a serious discussion of religion, interfaith dating, etc., seek out a spiritual leader, or a library, not a romantic-comedy DVD. Kudos to Edward Norton -- both because this was his first out as a director, and because his story pays due (and funny) respect to organized religion (and individual faith.) How long has it been since we've seen a film focusing on believing/involved people of faith that wasn't either preachy and sanctimonious, or cynical and paranoid? Let's see -- maybe Steve Martin's """"Leap of Faith"""", or Denzel Washington's remake of Cary Grant's """"The Preacher's Wife."""" Maybe a couple more -- but not many. It's nice to see a film celebrate active belief without turning into """"Father O'Malley and the Dirty Faced Street Urchins of New York"""" or """"Father O'Malley and the Dirty Alter Boys of Cell Block 8."""" And yes -- it's cute, funny, & light-hearted; AND seriously about friendship, tradition, matters of faith vs. matters of religion -- and people living in this century. """"Keeping the Faith"""" is an excellent movie that far exceeded our expectations. The writing is superb, and the acting couldn't be better. We recommend it very highly. The DVD got here in good shape. I don't really care for the movie tho. so have only watched"""	Keeping the Faith

I have all but 7 of his movies. I am working on getting the rest for my collection. My wife is a big Elvis fan and she loved the four movies especially Blue Hawaii. The picture quality and sound were excellent and she further said that she will watch them over and over again! I like older movies and this is one of the better moviecollections that I came across.it came in great condition and great price,also in fast delivery. Love Elvis movies I Love all Elvis movies! Fun feelgood movies with lots of beautiful scenes! Fun songs, beautiful ladies! Recommended for everyone!

While riding his cycle to the next gig  an irate dad runs him off the road when he flirts with his daughter. He's forced to hook up with a traveling carnival until his bike can be fixed. The carnival is run by a tough old broad  a broken down drunk and his nubile daughter. Along the way  Charlie (who's got a chip on his shoulder about being an orphan) somehow learns about family values from this vaguely dysfunctional one. A scheming rival carny shows up  based on the legend of Colonel Tom Parker  Elvis Presley's real life manager.Drama Musical Romance , egypt family motorcycle ,""THIS ONE IS REALLY GOOD ONE IT IS EXCITING AND ENTERTAING.hE WAS A GOOD NATURAL ACTOR.i wish he could had been to make the movies he wished to make .Good movies that he would have to made were denied him. THAT WAS A REAL HUGE EFFECT ON HIS SELF ESTEEM AND WHAT HE REALLY WANTED TO BE. A Any movie by elvis is ok with me. ..and I mean this in a good way. I am not that big of an Elvis fan really and never paid much attention to his films. Every now and again, I would catch one late at night and giggle a bit but be incredibly bored after about 5 mins. This one however is different! I was told by a friend of mine (an avid, if not rabid Elvis fan) that I had to see this. She called me late one night and told me it was on so I figured, what the hell? I ADORED it! The plot is ridiculous. It seems Elvis, our misunderstood biker/bad boy hero has his motorcycle almost destroyed by a small family run carnival owner who graciously has the bike fixed...but it will take some time. To make some spare travelin' cash..Elvis decides after much prodding to work at this carvial as a barker of sorts. The business is not going well and an EVIL carnival conglomorate wants to take it over (seriously, how silly is that?). Of course the plot thickens, carny daughter falls in love with bad boy Elvis, bad boy gets accused of making trouble (stealing a wallet..my word!), bad boy leaves for the big lights of a larger carnival but is wooed back by beautiful headstrong girl and of course because when all is said and done, Elvis does have a heart of gold! One of the best scenes is Elvis riding a motorcycle in a giant barrel, around and around and around...hilarious! The entire film is goofy but in a real good kitch sort of way. The thing that makes this movie is of course, Elvis and his singing. I have never heard such silly songs...""""It's Carnival Time"""" and """"Little Egypt"""" will leave you holding your sides, particularly with the """"dance"""" numbers! """"Big Love, Big Heartache"""" is actually a very good song, I would have to say one of my top 5 favourite Elvis songs. This film is good fun and the best part is, he really doesn't sweat all that much (have you noticed that in all the Hawaii films, it looks like a hose has been turned on him?). I had never seen this movie. Typical EP. I still love this film, complete with Elvis, pretty girls, and a terrific ensemble of character actors helping carry the plot. You don't have to think a whole lot but you will be entertained, and they remain-to this day-fun films...and the music is terrific. """"Hard Knocks"""" remains one of my favorite Elvis' songs. p.s. when you watch the opening scene where he is entertaining a group of college kids, see if you can recognize Raquel Welch, Teri Garr and Joy Harmon in the pack...pretty cool, hey? rl Classic Elvis movie at a good price. Arrived quickly, no damage. Great product! This goes with Eat the Peach. VERY NICE I DID RECEIVE IN 2 DAYS GREAT This Elvis flick leans to the dramatic. Not great drama, mind you, but more serious than the usual EP Grade B frolic. By 1964, Elvis was getting too old to be convincing as an """"angry young man,"""" but he gave it his best shot. Elvis is the motorbike-riding rebel whose singing peps up business at a struggling carnival. Elvis clashes with the hard-drinking ramrod, Joe (Leif Erickson). Joan Freeman and Elvis moon around each other, but find romance a rocky road. Movie veteran Barbara Stanwyck lends stature to the film as the carnival owner. The song writing teams of Giant-Baum-Kaye and Leiber-Stoller wrote some of the music, but the results are only mixed. On the plus side, the ballad """"Big Love, Big Heartache"""" and the comic """"Little Egypt"""" number are worth the effort of viewing. The other music is less memorable. One amusing footnote is Pat Buttram as a rival carnival owner. This was shortly before he enjoyed popular recogniton as Mr. Haney on TV's """"Green Acres."""" Given the movie's emphasis on the social mores of carnival folks, we wonder if Col. Tom Parker was in hog heaven, considering his carny background. The movie offers good Hal Wallis production values. Wallis once asserted he made flicks like this one to raise money for serious films like """"Becket."""" He considered Elvis trivial but profitable. Elvis fans will be pleased with this movie, regardless. Sample the cotton candy fluff. ;-) Good seller. Sold as described in ad Excellent movie. It arrived in really good condition. I am very happy with it. """"Roustabout"""" (1964) is a better-than-average Elvis Presley musical with the added bonus of Barbara Stanwyck in one of her last films. It's nice to see Elvis play an unsympathetic character for a change. Despite the upbeat ending, he's still a jerk and it's great when Stanwyck yells at him. The soundtrack is mostly forgettable but it includes one classic song, """"Little Egypt."""" As always, there are a few Elvis fight scenes to keep things lively. Overall, """"Roustabout"""" represents the last decent Presley vehicle before his downhill journey into schlock. Love Elvis Good movie entertainlng. Fun Elvis Presley movie Never get tired of it. a great film...loved it as a kid and I love it just as much now...definitely one to own in any collection very best My sister passed 3yrs ago and she was an Elvis fan. Every year on her birthday we watch his movies. Last year we watched a movie and also did Elvis Karaoke, as a celebration to her we always enjoy the movies and family time spent. the beautiful Terri Garr was in this movie as a chorus girl in the background and so was a wonderful man by the name of Richard Kiel who played Jaws in a James Bond movie. Elvis provided a great laugh in one scene where he sold a candy apple to this boy and when when the kid came back and said hey mister there's a worm in my apple......Elvis said there's no charge for the meat kid now beat it.......great line. Package was messed up. One of my favorites. It's Elvis. What can I say? A awesome movie, love it. Typical Elvis movie. Entertaining I bought it to see what Barbara Stanwyck and Elvis Presley were doing in the same movie. I saw the movie but I still don't know what they were doing in it together. Love this movie , I'am a huge Elvis fan ! Again Elvis is costarring with a classy cast. It was better then some of the Elvis films but it's a true fan who wants them all. It's fun to see the Elvis pals in bit parts too. Want to see a good clean movie well here is one to enjoy and makes for good memories as well. It may be an older movie but shows how changing ones attutide can bring about a better outlook of life and how to enjoy it to the fullest. I have watched this several time and intend to keep doing so. Elvis is still the Greatest in my opinion. Our boy is looking real cool in his black leather motorcycle jacket. A sharp dresser for sure. The movie is fun. Motorcycle lovers get to see Elvis on a Honda Superhawk. This movie does not have much of a plot. (After he returned from his time in army, this was the formula of movies he was in contract to do). This time Elvis rides a motor cycle, gets into fights,(usually with one of the guys from the Memphis Mafia who worked as extras, works at a carnival, loses the girl and then wins her back, oops I thnk I just gave the movie away! But if you really enjoy Elvis' voice and feel like stepping back in time and forgetting your troubles for a while, you will enjoy this movie. Little Egypt is a great song. Oh c'mon, its ELVIS!!! DVD came as described. It is a gift for a Dear Friend who loves Elvis as I do. Have to say I wish it were mine :)Thank you for it. I have most of his movies on DVD and trying to obtain them all. He was my favorite while growing up. What an intertainer along with a outstanding voice. I love everything about Elvis and have seen all his movies several times. I also collect things on him and have an Elvis room in my house. In one of his best movies, Elvis Presley plays a handsome, bonafide jerk who, on route to his next job, accidentally encounters Barbara Stanwyck, her even jerkier husband, and her beautiful step-daughter (Joan Freeman). Maggie (Stanwyck) decides to let Elvis become her dying carnival's roustabout, but he does more. When Elvis sings, well, you know what happens! The carnival begins to attract attention and the money starts rolling in. But when Elvis is offered a bigger salary by another carnie, he is torn between the prospects of a better life and his loyalty to Stanwyck, and particularly, her step-daughter. Every song in the film is """"a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful"""" experience. Elvis's fun rockin' with """"Poision Ivy League"""" to his romantic wooing of Freeman in a ferris wheel, to the upbeat """"It's Carnival Time"""" the big production number, """"Little Egypt"""", and the final, memorable number, """"And The Whole World's Gonna Be Mine"""". And Stanwyck is just great as the good-hearted carnie whom Elvis learns to trust. You'll have fun with this movie or buy it for the Elvis fan in your family... """"be a big shot for a dollar, it's Carnival Time!"""" Charlie Rodgers (Elvis Presley) is a coffee shop singer. As the movie opens, he is fired after a short fight is picked. Film after film, after film, after film, after film, after film, after film, after film, after film, and did I mention after film, we see Elvis Presley's characters fighting. But yet, that is all what we see Elvis Presley doing singing and fighting. But yet if he has a job he almost aways loses his jobs. Charlie is hired by Maggie Morgan to be her carnvial's Roustabout. Yet we never see him in another sport film besides racing. Whether in cars or in boats. And for the time he meets a lot of female characters in films. And maybe even fight for the women. But why would Charlie Rodgers get a job as a Roustabout? In yet, Elvis almost aways finds a way out of fights, even if it lands him in jail and costs his job. But yet are we supposed to be happy for Elvis Presley's chacters. Even if we don't find it in our hearts to be happy for his characters. And have other people like his he is a father or mother or both bail him out instead of sending him in jail for a time in jail. Like a couple of months or weeks or years. Doesn't Elvis Presley get tired of playing characters that get into this sticky mess. Charlie has a motor bike but gets broken and stays at a carnival until it is fixed. As far as I can discern, the only reason anyone would buy """"Roustabout"""" or """"Easy Come Easy Go"""", etc. is to see Elvis perform the admittedly weak songs. In lieu of anything else in the films, singing is all there is to enjoy; I'd hazard to guess 99.99% of viewers aren't expecting an engrossing story. So how does Paramount treat the folks who would buy these musicals? Pretty poorly. There's zero extras (some of their Presley releases don't even include the trailers) and, worst of all, many of them don't even have chapter access to the"""	Roustabout

The script is lame, all the """"mafia"""" folks are anything but Sicilian (laughably so), Jack is definitely no Italian and not even very convincing in this role (he's just not a tough guy, deep down), and how did Angelica get an Oscar for this? She's barely ok, and her father's direction is some of the worst of his mostly splendid career. This whole film just feels weak and flaccid. It might be meant to be a joke but it's almost never that funny, not very dramatic, and basically just flat. I wanted to like it but facts is facts. I've no idea why it seems so good to so many. Rose lenses as well? Have they seen GoodFellas, Casino, or the Godfather? THOSE are real mob flicks, black humor and all. THIS is some weird mishmash that just never gets off the ground. All the plot twists add up to little suspense. And some of the looping (voice dubbing) is simply horrible! It's like a bad 70s tv show at times. There are some amusing moments and Jack is never all bad, but his chemistry with Turner is weak, and she seems very poor up against Jack's aura (even when he's weak he's a star, some guys just got it). I love Jack and John Huston is one hell of a director when he's happening (though Polanski used Jack to far greater effect, and Huston too for that matter, in Chinatown), but save your time and watch the Godfather parts one and two again (or Chinatown, also long but more gracefully so). They are classics. This is a b-movie. Eh A mafia movie starring Jack Nicholson (one of the worlds greatest actors; ever) and co-staring greats like Anjelica Huston and Robert Loggia, directed by the well respected John Huston; I mean, this is a dream come true right? Close. `Prizzi's Honor' is a black comedy revolving around a mafia family and their dysfunctional lives, and for the most part this movie nails it. There are a few misfires, sadly, but I would be lying if I said that this wasn't very satisfying despite those shortcomings. Charley Partanna is the number one hitman for the Prizzi family. He was at one time engaged to Dominic Prizzi's daughter Maerose. After humiliating her family and Charley (by shacking up with another guy) Maerose is ostracized by the family, allowed only to interact with them on special occasions. The film opens on such an occasion, the wedding of Maerose's sister. At this wedding Charley happens to meet Irene, a beautiful blonde who strikes his fancy. They dance, they part, they reunite, they fall in love and decide to marry. Turns out that Irene is also a hit(wo)man and complications thus ensue as her identity is revealed. Twists and turns and doublecrossments abound as the film spirals towards a very `Mr. and Mrs. Smith' type conclusion; all of which add layers to this well written and well acted film. The script is a gem, caging wit alongside passion and espionage to create a smart and engaging film that is as thrilling as it is comical. The gags are subtle, never over-the-top (this isn't `Mafia' people) and they elevate the film, giving it an edge that is welcome. The performances make and break this film; and this is precisely what I mean about a few misfires. First off, Jack Nicholson delivers seriously one of his finest performances of all time. This one ranks up with `The Shining' and `About Schmidt' for me as one of the `other' layers of Jack. For anyone who claims that Jack can only play `Jack' they need to watch this film. He creates a perfect comedic caricature complete with a new voice, a new walk and a new smile. He's completely transformed. Kathleen Turner is one of those actresses I feel never got as big as she should have been. She always seems to really entertain me, and while I felt that she took a backseat to Nicholson here (he really is all sorts of amazing) she really did her best to rise above. Robert Loggia is another standout. He is one of those actors who acts from his head to his toes, and he pulls it off brilliantly. I remember a scene in particular when he walks out of an elevator and chats up a young lady. He's out of focus and practically out of view yet our attention is driven to him because he is still very much in character. And then we come to William Hickey and Anjelica Huston; the two Oscar nominees (Nicholson was also nominated, but deservedly so). I really wanted to like these performances, but they were either extremely annoying or nothing special at all. Hickey for instance was awful in my book. I loathed seeing him on the screen. I really wish that Loggia had received the Oscar nomination instead for his performance was much richer and far better executed. Huston was not bad, but she did nothing special for me. I really enjoyed her `there is no honor' speech, but I feel that her win was unnecessary (as was her nomination) and that she really only took home the Oscar because of her family ties. Avery, Winfrey and Tilly were much more deserving. In the end though, I must admit that despite its few shortcomings the film really delivers. It's funny, it's smart and it's engaging from start to finish and Nicholson really delivers a knockout performance. I guaranty that you'll enjoy this movie (that is unless you don't) and highly recommend it to any fan of the cast or the genre. I love gangster movies, and this one has an edge. A solid B+, maybe even an A- thanks to an A+ performance by Jacky-Boy. Fun movie The Bottom Line: Since I'm apparently the only person in the world who thinks this movie is terrible (despite loving John Huston and Jack Nicholson), it's my duty to report to you that Prizzi's Honor is overlong, completely unfunny, and a waste of two hours; I went in expecting something near a great film and went out feeling that this should never be mentioned in the same sentence as Treasure of the Sierra Madre or The Man Who Would Be King. Somehow I missed this 1985 film when it was in the theaters. That's why I was delighted that it was available on cable. From the very beginning I was instantly engaged in a compelling story that was pure comic genius as well as having a touch of tragedy. Jack Nicholson is cast as a hit man in a Mafia family. He's amazing in this role and even gets the New York Brooklyn accent right. The film opens at a wedding with all its pomp and glory. That's where Nicholson spots the blonde and beautiful Kathleen Turner. He asks her to dance and is immediately smitten. Suddenly she is called away. Who is she? Why was she at the wedding. All this is a mystery at first. Eventually Nicholson romances the evasive Turner. He's in love. He wants to marry her. And then he finds out that she, too, is an assassin and they both work for the same bosses. The plot twists and turns and Angelica Houston, who later won an Academy Award for her role in this film, is cast as the black sheep of the family with her own grudge to bear against Nicholson, is looking for her own kind of revenge. How this all plays out is the stuff of dark comedy which kept my eyes glued to the screen and had me laughing out loud at times. The film is 130 minutes long but the plot moved with the speed of light; there wasn't one boring minute. This is pure and slightly offbeat entertainment. Try not to miss it. After watching """"Chinatown"""" I was curious to see """"Prizzi's Honor,"""" because of the whole Nicholson/Anjelica Huston on again/off again romance that began around the time that Chinatown was shot. There was so much drama behind the set of Chinatown that it was a wonder that the film was made at all, let alone that it was a film noir masterpiece, so my review of Chinatown didn't delve into the father/daughter aspect, but as you may know, John Huston played Noah Cross and Nicholson, as detective Jake Gittes, is involved with Cross' daughter (played by Faye Dunaway). He confronts Noah, who has got to be the worst father since, well, Noah, and I couldn't help wondering how Nicholson's offscreen romance with Huston's daughter affected their respective performances. So, in Prizzi's Honor, Nicholson and John Huston are working together again, but this time Huston is the director, and Anjelica Huston is onscreen this time, as the daughter of a powerful mob family. Anjelica really steals the whole film, and wins an Oscar for her performance. It helps, I guess, if your father is the director, if you are going to steal a film from the ostensible leads, but though John Huston may have been an accessory to the crime, it was really Anjelica's performance that got her that Oscar. She was also great in """"The Grifters,"""" if you require further proof of her talent. In Prizzi's Honor, though, she is shown mercilessly manipulating her father, and I'm wondering if John Huston was going, like, so that's how she does it? Anjelica was the best thing about Prizzi's Honor, and as for Director John Huston, Jack Nicholson, and Kathleen Turner, it was not their best work. The main problem I had with Prizzi's Honor was that it was written as a set up for the premise: what if a hit man and a hit woman fell in love, but then each one was hired to kill the other? It was mostly put together well enough so that you are not aware of the carpenters hammering and sawing behind the scenery, but there were a few gaping holes in the plot. Kathleen Turner was adequate as the femme fatale, but didn't generate the body heat she did in """"Who Killed Roger Rabbit?"""" let alone """"Body Heat."""" Nicholson was really off his game. What was that accent supposed to be? Brooklynese? He reminded me of Archie Bunker, without that man's wit and wisdom. He seemed dazed and confused, and yet he was going to be put in charge of the Prizzi family business? The """"love at first sight"""" he was supposed to feel for Turner's hit woman wasn't convincing. When he struggled to articulate his """"feelings"""" it was really cringe worthy. I liked William Hickey, the guy who played Don Corrado Prizzi. He had a really gravely voice that could have become grating real fast--but I enjoyed his performance. Perhaps it was meant to be a parody of Marlon Brando as the Godfather. At least he didn't stuff an orange in his mouth. Bottom line is Prizzi's Honor is mainly Anjelica's honor, but for the rest, not their best work. Still, they are all so talented, even when it is not their best work, it is still better than most. John Huston and Jack Nicholson, and many others, were nominated for Oscars for this, but Anjelica is the only one who won one. Though the studio didn't expect it to do well, positive word-of-mouth built up slowly but surely. ------------ Irene Walker: Charley, I've been doin' three to four hits a year for the past couple of years, most at full pay.

Recommended If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them. Is the remake of """"Gone in 60 Seconds"""" a masterpiece? No. Is it better than the original? Debatable, to say the least. One thing is for sure, this film has been unfairly sliced and diced by blood thirsty critics, and it did not deserve that. """"Gone in 60 Seconds"""" is indeed a very witty, smart, sexy (Angelina Jolie is in it, isn't she?), Buckheimer film. One thing though, like other reviewers here have said, this is a devout car film, and viewers who don't really care much about cars might spend a lot of time during the movie rolling their eyes. But, for all the car lovers out there, at least try renting it, huh? I've written some longer reviews lately and i'm tired. so i shall be brief in my attempt to summarize gone in sixty seconds the new one with Cage. It's stupid slow with no true high octane chase scenes like the original. it seems to only bare its resemblance to the original in general idea and name. it's not very good. Jolie is barely in the movie Ribisi and Duvall's talents are as expected wasted. Nice cars but with no real plot to help distinguish itself and not any really good acting it falls short of even just three stars. thank you and have a good day or night whichever it is. Basic storyline: Little Kip (Ribisi) botches a 50-car boost and his big brother Memphis (Cage) comes to the rescue. They steal a bunch of really nice cars, including a 67 Shelby GT at the end. If you can suspend reality a bit, the movie is fun. It's tough to watch with my boyfriend because he is always pointing out how unrealistic everything is. I saw the movie for what it is: Pure fun. It's not an Oscar type movie that is supposed to provoke deep thoughts. My problems with it - 1) Angelina Jolie was not in it enough. 2) I'm not a fan of Ribisi and his character seemed like a whiny little baby the entire movie. 3) I had to make myself ignore the zillions of unrealistic things that happened (ie: the helicopter flying 15 feet off the ground chasing the Shelby GT). Basically it's a fun flick to watch if you like pretty cars, but people who are very analytical about movies will probably hate it. Like I always say, just enjoy the movie and stop worrying about the flaws. When you do that, this movie is a blast. A great movie. Enjoy. As """"Gone in Sixty Seconds"""" begins to unfold, it gives you one of two different options: you can either scrutinize its inane sense of logic, disinteresting plot, and lack of intriguing character development. Or, you can do what I did, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a ride it is. True, all of the above statements threaten to bog the movie down, but director Dominic Sena, teaming up with pyrotechnic-master Bruckheimer, fills the screen with some very high-speed action that is more intense than most might give it credit for. Simplicity is all the rage in the story, which centers around Memphis Raines (Nicholas Cage), a former car theft professional whose brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) is the latest target of a mobster who hired him to boost expensive cars. After a heist that went sour, he's out to kill Kip, but agrees to walk if Memphis can deliver 50 cars of various makes and models to him in three days. So, like any devoted and loving brother would do, he rounds up his former gang of car thieves and makes plans to boost the vehicles one night before the scheduled shipment. That's all you really need to know, except for a few side stories involving a romantic past between Memphis and the lusty Sway (Angelina Jolie). The entire plot is predictable, beginning to end, reason being that since the movie is rated PG-13, we automatically know two things: a) nothing overtly violent will be taking place, and b) due to this lack of violence, nothing very shocking is going to be taking place. But for the most part, the movie pays off with a lightweight amount of good-natured action setups that accomplish what they promise. There's the various escapes from the bumbling cops (including two detectives who appear to have come straight from a bad TV cop show), many of which provide us with some very intense chases as cars swerve in and out of traffic, dodge garbage trucks, crash into other cars, etc. Sena crowns this off with a very effective, if somewhat cheesy, finale in which Raines steals the car he could never control, and takes it for the ride we all dream of taking. Thrown into the mix is a cast that appears to be having so much fun with the material that I almost felt left out when trying to pick the movie apart. Cage is back in the bad-boy form we have come to love him for, and is interaction with the delectable Jolie provide some very witty one-liners and even some awkward chemistry. Among the cast are Robert Duvall as a shady mechanic, and Ribisi in one of his less-appealing roles, but everyone seems to have high spirits, which helps the movie keep up a pretense of fun. I'm not usually a sucker for schlocky thrills, but """"Gone in Sixty Seconds"""" had me laughing and watching in all the right places. The title is a pretty good summation of its own plot, and though I found the film to be completely mindless, there's enough good, raunchy humor and more-than-mediocre action sequences to make up for its lack of intriguing story. If you're reading this review to determine the depths of acting muster displayed in the film, then you obviously haven't seen it yet.... If you've read any of my other film reviews then you know that I'm an Angelina Jolie fan and I've recently added this to my collection of Jolie films on DVD. Reviewed as an Angelina Jolie film - Three stars for this one and that's because Angelina doesn't show up for about half an hour and then, she's barely featured - don't buy into the DVD cover or movie poster that feature her prominently. She's just the best looking cast member. First - the DVD. The interfaces are pretty cool. Lots of nice graphics and car sounds. It gets a little tired if you're spending some time just zooming around the features though. A small interview with Angelina Jolie is featured under the """"Old School"""" catagory of the special features. It's short, though, so be warned. The most you get out of it was that Angelina Jolie came up with the whole """"look"""" of Sway ( that character she plays in the film )...which, I'm thinking, was probably more fun for her than the limited acting she was asked to do. As far as the film itself, it's an okay movie. It's no masterpiece. It's basically a little plot wrapped around a lot of stunt car chases. Nothing wonderous or even particularily original. The plot revolves around Nicolas Cage and his """"old school"""" gang of car theives having to do one last big run in order to save his younger brother from a ... well, this is starting to sound much more complex than the movie lets on so I'll stop here before I give something away. Needless to say, Nicholas Cage has made better films. Mostly he's talking in that """"8mm"""" whispered voice that's supposed to make him seem mature and deep. It doesn't exactly work, I mean, the guys a car thief. For those gearheads out there ( and I mean that affectionately ) there are some very cool cars featured. Notably the Shelby GT. Very cool. Ferarri's are featured ( Angelina says """"hello ladies"""" ) as are just about every really """"hot"""" sports car. You just get a glimpse of most of them, though. Note that none of the cars are suped-up or special a la """"The Fast and The Furious"""" but the cars featured here are actually a shopping list, not a personal vehicle. Robert Duvall is featured - he's doing that """"Days of Thunder"""" talking to the car thing he's apparently mastered. Giovanni Ribisi is along for the ride if you'll pardon the pun. He's done a lot of better work than this. See """"Saving Private Ryan"""" if you want to realize a bit of his depth. Back to Angelina Jolie's performance...""""phoned in"""" would be appropriate. I'm not even sure why she'd take a part like this, with so little character. She's got the look ( which she apparently defined ) and she's nice to look at...when we get that chance. I'll remind you that she's not on screen all that often. In all, she's probably only got 20 minutes or so of screen time. To make an obtuse Angelina Jolie jump - the character she plays here could very well be the older incarnation of """"Legs"""" from Foxfire ( a much, much better Angelina Jolie film ). They appear to wear the same boots <G>. So, yes, this is a must have for the completist, but everyone else should probably just wait for it on cable. Special DVD Easter Egg Note : The information regarding an Easter Egg on this DVD is not true. There is a 1974 original version of this film available on DVD and that DVD does contain an Easter Egg, this version does not. Best Regards, turtlex PS - if you've enjoyed this review, please read some of my others and feel free to add me to your """"favorite people"""" list. I hate how much suspence there was and how loud and sudden the graphics were. Nick cage was in one of his worst movies yet. (But the family man was pretty terrible too)I would not recomend this movie tp anyone has bad reactions to loud noises.lololol (Analisa) hahahahahahahaha Before watching this movie I had heard many bad reviews about this film. They were wrong! This is a great car movie with lots of action. Cage gives an impressive performance as a master car thief who comes out of retirement to help save his younger brother. The only thing he has to do is steal 50 cars in 3 days! There was not much character development, but the action scenes make up for it. This movie made me want to go outside and drive somewhere, fast. Don't miss this gem. I really cant say enough about this movie. It is totally awsome, and few people agree. Many people trash talked this film, critics and audiences alike. And I think that it deserves more recognition. The film doesnt have the best acting, but the"""	Gone in 60 Seconds
